      "I've been researching different LED lightbulbs, and I found some [4-watt \\(40-watt equivalent\\) bulbs](http://amzn.com/B00CPQZLHY) for $7.72 each (free shipping). I currently use 60-watt incandescents pretty much everywhere in my house, but the ones that are on most of the time are my three porch lights, two hallway lights, and the lamp in my livingroom.\n",

      "\n",
      "I estimate these lights are on an average of 16 hours per day (high, I know). This comes out to 480 hours per light per month (average of 30 days per month). With each bulb using 60 watts, that comes out to 28.8 kilowatts used by each bulb each month. In total, 172.8 kilowatts is used to power all six bulbs each month. At $0.10 per kilowatt (my current electricity rate), this means the bulbs are costing me a total of $17.28 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, break that down into simple terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 16(hours per day)*365/12(days in month)=486.67(hr/mo)\n",

      "\n",
      "* 2.92*6(total number of bulbs)=17.52(total cost per month)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since fifteen 4-watt bulbs equal one 60-watt bulb, divide the total cost by 15 to get the total cost per month of the LED bulbs: $1.17\n",
      "\n",
      "If my math checks out, I can expect to save ~$16.35 per month on my electricity bill. At $7.72 per LED bulb, I will earn back the money I spent on them after three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the prices are reasonable enough now that it is a good idea to make the switch. I actually plan on switching out the rest of my lights, but I figured I'd do the ones I use the most first and see how it works. Hopefully this helps some of you who wish to cut down on your electric bill, as well.\n",

I just made my last payment a few months ago, but I could have saved 5 years of headache and worries (and probably $10,000) if I bought a reasonable used car.

I haven't tried to make fries or fried chicken, since I don't have a deep fryer, but I think I could make these for substantially less than at any fast food joint.

      "Edit: enough folks have been confused that I need to clarify: this is absolutely NOT a post telling folks not to try new things. Please try new things! There's a lot of good tips here on where to start and how to keep going, even. This *is* a reminder to accurately value all of your resources, though. \n",

      "But some you either don't assign a value to the skills you have and the time it takes to do a repair or make something new and it colors your opinion of what frugal is. Or you forget how much your tools cost. Or you're so used to your skillset (or you learned some skills so young) that you've forgotten how much time and effort went into acquiring those skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are able to go to a wholesaler and get raw materials and turn it into what you need because you have the infrastructure to do so: you know how to make or repair the thing, you have the tools you need, you've practiced the skills you'll be using so you're not in unknown waters, and you know how to make the time to do the thing and get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newbies to repair and making have none of that. Newbies especially don't have years of previous mistakes to build from (let's be real, we learn the most from mistakes). They don't have the experience to know how to fix their mistakes or be assured that they'll be able to live with imperfect repairs and bad makes. They don't even know what they need to learn in order to do the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most frugal option in any given situation is the one you can actually *do* with the resources you have. Buying from Amazon may be penny smarter, but buying *the wrong thing* from Amazon because you thought you understood what you were buying but didn't and didn't get what you needed isn't. Buying something without a clear idea of the tools you need before doing so, only to discover the tools you need are *hundreds* of dollars or require a ton of practice and education before you can do the thing is not frugal. It's also not frugal to buy tools and materials you don't know how to use and destroying them in the process of doing the thing because you don't know how to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Repair is a *skill*. It's a really valuable skill, actually. It's a skill that most of us have to teach ourselves because we don't have access to thriving repair communities. Self-teaching is really hard and rife with time, material, and financial expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "And honestly repairing or making out of upcycled materials is *even harder*, though it's the literal cheapest option. It requires taking trash and turning it into a usable material before you even get to do the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your time is more valuable than your money. Your skills are more valuable than both. Your knowledge is priceless. Don't devalue yourself so by forgetting how much wealth you have in your non-financial resources when considering how to resolve someone's question. Also don't discount the human resources in physical stores. The value of the ability to show a newbie how to figure out what they need to complete a task is immeasurable.\n",

      "Now, I know as a rule frugal people don't buy Starbucks drinks. But say you're in a hurry and you need a caffeine fix, or you're a tea junkie like me and couldn't wait for your kettle to boil some water before your class/work/whatever. Or maybe your with some friends who all want to go to Starbucks (Because, say what you will about Starbucks, but if you want a place to hang out with your friends other than your house, Starbucks is much cheaper than a restaurant or bar), how can you save money?\n",
      "\n",
      "I've worked at Starbucks a long time now, and there's a few things you can do to hack the system. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brewed coffee is cheap enough. Ask for a pour over of their bold coffee for a fresher cup. It takes a few minuets, but it's fresher and costs the same amount. Also, if you and several of your friends all want coffee, ask for a French Press. It's around 4 dollars and is approximately 45 oz of fresh, hot, French pressed coffee. *And* you can pick whichever blend you'd like. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want espresso, avoid the options already on the menu board. Americanos cost just a little more than a cup of brewed coffee, but packs more of a caffeine punch because it's espresso and hot water. It tastes like coffee and you can sweeten it just like you would your normal cup of coffee. More bang for your buck. If you want an extra shot, don't ask for one. Ask for a \"grande Americano in a tall cup\". That way, they charge you an extra 30 cents, instead of an extra 70 cents for the shot of espresso. This works because Grande Americanos get three shots. Same would work for a Venti. My manager tells all his partners to do this by default, whether the customer asks for it that way or not, but other stores may not be so nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you like iced drinks, asking for a triple espresso in a Venti cup over ice, and then filling it with milk after the fact at the condiment bar is a great way to get an iced latte for about 2 dollars. Even adding a flavor (which is 40 cents extra) still saves you about 50%. Unfortunately, there's no real way to do this with hot lattes, as you need a barista to steam the milk for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you and a friend are out and want a Frappuccino, ask for a Venti split into two tall cups. Iced venti cups are 24 oz. Tall are 12. Viola. Two talls would cost you about 6 bucks, a venti, 4. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are secretly a Starbucks junkie, there's a new loyalty program Starbucks came out with. You get a Starbucks gift card (Not credit), register it online, and pay with your card each time, reloading it as you go. You get a free drink (Any kind of drink, not matter how expensive) every 10 transactions or so. You get a free tall coffee with each purchase of a 1lb of coffee and a free tall drink of your choice for each 2lbs. You also get a free drink on your birthday. If you have one of these, and are getting drinks for multiple people, ring up each drink separately. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you want a good coffee that is also quick and easy, Starbucks is pressuring their stores *profusely* to up their VIA sales. It's instant, water soluble coffee. No chemicals, no freeze drying. Actually quite good. I've used it when I'm staying in a hotel and it tastes just like coffee (Get the bold Italian Roast though, not the Colombian). A 12 pack of that stuff is $9.95. Not bad price per cup. And it dissolves in hot or cold water and even milk (.98 cent latte anyone?). It's a good gift for someone who works in an office with bad coffee or travels a lot. It's also wonderful in cooking. Act very skeptical and ask a lot of questions about it. If you don't get offered a free drink or some other deal with it within 2 minuets, I'd be very surprised. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you buy Starbucks coffee in a grocery store, it will come with a coupon for a free tall cup of coffee. In actuality, the ring code works for any size. In addition to that, if you want a more expensive drink, we can take the price of a tall coffee off for you from the original price. Also, talk about how you're now out of coffee. The barista will most likely offer you a pound of our coffee for the same price as the grocery store coffee (The grocery store coffee is a smaller bag and is around 7 dollars, the bags in retail stores are 1lb and cost about 9 or 10). They can also grind it custom for you. As a side note, you can get any of our coffees weighed out. You can buy a full 1lb, a 1/2lb and a 1/4lb. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, make friends with a barista. They will most likely hook you up with free drinks a lot. Further more, if you get to be really good friends, Starbucks baristas get a weekly coffee/tea/VIA markout. My boyfriend's parents and my parents never have to buy coffee because I get it for free. Furthermore, we get partner shopping days around the holidays, 40% off everything. Starbucks is a great place to get presents for those people you don't know very well (distant co-workers, secret santas, teachers, etc) and you can save a lot of money by asking a barista you know to buy it for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, you get 10 cents off your drink if you bring in your own cup/use one of ours. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just say, that a lot of people don't understand why Starbucks drinks are so expensive. We *hand-make everything*. Well, not everything, but most of it. We make our own whipped cream, the Frappuccinos are hand made with real coffee and milk, teas are full leaf, the mocha is made fresh everyday and the Chai concentrate is all natural. You can get whatever drink you can possibly think of. Our pasteries are now made without HFCS, artificial colors, or preservatives. Our coffees are sourced ethically (Bucks pays a higher price for raw coffee than say, Folgers or DD and all of the espresso and brewed coffee in European stores are certified Fair Trade), and, further more, they treat their employees well. That's not say we get paid well or that there isn't bullshit politics, but every barista, part time or full, is given cheap health coverage, 401k, stock options, savings plans, tuition reimbursement, etc, etc. Last year each partner was given a stock grant, and this year we're each getting a bonus and generous matches on our 401ks because of Starbucks' success in pulling out of the recession pretty damn well. Furthermore, baristas are specially trained and certified. Yes, not all of them are worth a shit, but we're not simply counter-help. We learn how to properly froth milk, how to discern different flavor notes in a coffee, etc. Ask someone at DD what the difference between a coffee grown in Latin America as opposed to Indonesia, and they'll look at you like you have two heads. \n",
      "\n",
      "A good way to tell if a store is good or not is through two ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Drive Thrus. Many drive thru stores are not as good as a cafe-only store. But say that a drive-thru store also has...\n",
      "\n",
      "* Newer espresso machines. The older ones have the separate hoppers for the decaf and espresso beans and have two metal steam wands. The newer ones have a retro look to them, with pink enamel on the back and a flying-saucer looking hopper on top. The stores with these machines make more money, and therefore probably have better management/better staff. Also, the espresso is better from these machines, as the shots are timed with each pour, so the barista can better maintain the quality of the pour. The old machines had to be timed and calibrated every four hours or so, and, a lot of times, that just doesn't get done.\n",
      "\n",
      "* However, unlike the new machines, the old machines can only pour two shots at a time. That means if you get a Grande Americano with three shots, will have a fourth one going down the drain, unless you ask the barista nicely if they could throw it in for you. Sometimes, if you're friendly from the get go, the barista will just do it anyways. And viola! Free shot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "ALSO. Not that I would believe any of you to be guilty of this, but if you're bitchy to a barista, you're possibility of them 'accidentally' giving you decaf just went up about 70%. By the same token, complimenting the barista on bar on the quality of your drink will pretty much be the highlight of their day. I can say from experience, a man once said to me \"You're so smart [sip] and you make a damn good cappuccino,\" the cappuccino part was the one that stayed with me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this helps you save a bit! Happy coffee drinking!\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: \n",
      "Finally, if you come in and ask for a cup of coffee and see that the little red light on the brewer is blinking, ask politely for a fresher batch, or just go with a pour over. The red light starts blinking after an hour. At my store, we're pretty strict about the 30 minute time limit on our coffees, but other stores aren't. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, if you come in and act like you're in a huge hurry and don't want to wait for a decaf or bold pour over, but are still nice enough about it, we'll make you an Americano for the same price as a coffee and get you out of there quick.\n",

      "Because I like data and charts, here's a picture of [my next 26 paycheck dates](https://imgur.com/a/cyedm) and the total bills that are due after that check, but before the next payday. \n",
      "\n",
      "My takehome is about $1078 per paycheck on average. As you can see, in that 26 bi-weekly period, there would be 3 paychecks where my bills are more than my takehome. (And 3 more paychecks where bills would take up nearly my whole check.) If every payday I paid my bills that were due, and considered the rest of the paycheck available for groceries, eating out, etc., there would be those paychecks that I was in hot water and start getting late fees, insufficient fund penalties, etc. because my check wasn't enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then again, there's every so often where I would have nearly $800 leftover after paying all the bills that were due after that paycheck (and yes, these are typically near when I get 3 paychecks in a month). These are keys to breaking out of living paycheck-to-paycheck. You can see at the bottom of the picture that my average bills are $678, meaning my \"other\" spending available to me is $400/paycheck for food, clothes, gas, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "If those \"extra\" paychecks I kept only spending $400 on the misc./\"nonbill\" spending and SAVED that extra $400 instead of seeing $800 of available money and spending all of it, eventually I would have enough buffer built up. I'd never again need to scramble during those paychecks where my bills exceed my income.\n",
      "\n",
      "So **MY SIMPLE SYSTEM FOR HOW I PERSONALLY STOPPED LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK**: what I do is get that $400 directly deposited into a separate checking account when I get paid. I can spend that entire $400 on groceries, movies, concerts, booze, whatever. I ALWAYS can spend that $400 each check (or save it for vacations, put extra towards debt, whatever my goals are). The rest of my paycheck, the other $678, gets deposited into the \"bills\" checking account which is essentially always at $0 available. I may look at it today and it may have a $1200 balance sometimes. But this chart I've linked to shows how I don't REALLY have $1200, since eventually it will be needed for some future bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, there's always the money for those set bills, and I don't really have to \"budget\" each month. An emergency fund for unexpected expenses helps, too. But forecasting for the next year and getting that average amount directly deposited made the biggest difference for me when I was starting out.\n",

      "Hi r/frugal ! My first post here but I wanted to share how I went from spending $600 (😳) a month to less than $200 a month on groceries for a family of 2. And I want to clarify - groceries here encompasses both food and household essentials (toilet paper, trash bags, soap, etc) I’m on mobile so apologies in advance for any formatting errors. Many of these tips you may already know but if you’re a newbie like me, all this blew my mind and may help you. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Make a spreadsheet. This took the longest - I hunkered down on a Saturday and made a list of the most common 50 items I buy at a grocery store. I then created 4-6 separate columns for each. If you haven’t already checked it out, KrazyCouponLady has what they call a “stock up pile price list” for many common household items. They have prices for 3 & 6 months - if you see it for x price, stock up for 3 months. If you see it for y price, stock up for 6. They don’t recommend stocking up more than 6 months as things tend to go bad and unless you’re super on top of it, you’ll likely forget you have it and are likely to double purchase. Anyway, I added the 3 and 6 month prices to my spreadsheet, then each additional column is the lowest priced comparable item (I’m not comparing Charmin Ultra vs. 1 ply toilet paper - not a fair comparison) for each of my grocery stores. Here’s the key - GO BY PRICE PER POUND/UNIT/OUNCE. More often than not, Costco was cheaper than Walmart and Kroger for household items and some grocery items. Aldi consistently has the cheapest meat. However, some instances where Walmart was cheaper (heavy whipping cream and sour cream are two examples). Highlight the cheapest item for each of your stores and there’s your base. All in all, it took me about 3 hours but I never have to do it again and it’s already saved me hundreds of dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "Editing to add because this question has come up a few times: Kroger and Walmart list their prices in the app and online. Costco and Aldi have price lists linked here. https://queenbeecoupons.com/costco-price-list-updated-with-600-per-unit-prices/?m\n",
      "\n",
      "https://www.simplegrocerydeals.com/aldi-price-list/\n",

      "It’s important to note prices will vary by region so I’d recommend keeping an up to date spreadsheet for your use and make notes of any discrepancies when you are out shopping. \n",
      "\n",
      "SECOND EDIT: I went ahead and made a shareable spreadsheet. Please note I live in north DFW so your pricing may vary but feel free to use as a starting point for yours - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zz17MCUGDRKTp86LQHFJh6NqTLNOmm9n8KTTrYMsUm8/edit?usp=sharing\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Take inventory of what you have. Many people, myself included until I switched to this method, make a menu based on what they want to eat this week. They then go to the store and buy ingredients to make said items. Don’t do this. Take inventory of what you have on hand, because you likely can make meals out of that. What’s on its way out in the fridge? What’s already open in your pantry? Take inventory of everything, including your freezer, and literally google “ground beef rice beans dish” and go from there. If you’re not creative, the internet will take care of the rest. And for bonus points, if you make it and like it, save the recipe and start a recipe binder. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. For everything else, buy what’s on sale. If you take nothing else from this post except this one thing, download Flipp. It aggregates all your local grocer circulars into one app where you can make a grocery list and find the cheapest price for that item this week.  The items I have had to buy, are always on sale w the exception of things like produce. For February, I spent $180 on groceries which included a $70 Costco purchase of trash bags, charmin, clorox and more household essentials that were all on sale and some even lower than the 6 month stock up price list. Now that’s $70 I won’t have to spend for the next 6 months that can go back into buying other stuff on sale to make stock piles, buying more food with my budget, or just saving!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lastly - utilize that freezer! If your budget permits, buy more than you can (within reason) and stock up. I bought 10 pounds of local ground beef on sale at Aldi that was marked down even more to $10 for 10 pounds. Did I need 10 pounds of ground beef that week? Nope! But for just a few more dollars than what I was planning on spending, I doubled my ground beef reserve and had a stock pile to make dishes for the entire month. Same thing w $2.99 chuck roast at Kroger or $0.79 chicken thighs. Out of $180, $70 was spent on meat that was on sale, $70 for household essentials, and the rest in filling in the items to make meals. \n",

      "\n",
      "Okay time for tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**Most likely what you grew up eating, will be the cheapest thing for you to cook.** Whether you’re hispanic, asian, american, european…you have familiarity with the flavors and your pantry is probably already geared towards that pallet bringing the cost per meal way lower. For instance, I’m hispanic and I know off the top of my head 10 different rice recipes just because I grew up eating them, even if some of them I can’t cook just yet, I know how they’re suppose to taste and what’s involved in it. Give me a potato and I only know how to boil it. Maybe I’ll add it to one of my hispanic dishes, but guess what? I’m still cooking rice to go with it. Speaking about cost per meal, I quickly realized how expensive it was to branch to diff food profiles, I wanted to learn how to cook more asian dishes and kinda had to stop haha, I had no room in my small kitchen for all the additional spices and noodles needed. I settled with some of the basic condiments (sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce and kewpie lol) incase I want to venture off a bit, again a lot of these asian meals also involved rice. Leading me to my biggest point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**Stick to one carb and run with it**, I rarely cook with potatoes, bread or pasta, my go-to carb is rice (no surprise). I know a lot of people complain about just eating rice and beans to be frugal. But take for instance, if you love potatoes, there’s literally hundreds of different ways to make potatoes interesting, seriously you really can’t get bored of something you *like* to eat. I think that’s the key. I do keep a box of spaghetti handy, and my bf buys bagels for his breakfast, and every once in a while I’ll venture into other things but 80% of the time we’re eating rice and beans (with a salad and a protein).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**We buy the same protein every two weeks.** We buy chicken breast (more on that later), pork-chop (sometimes bone it sometimes not), ground beef (80/20) and shrimp. Every two weeks we run out of them, and we buy them again. If one gets too expensive, we buy an alternative (like ground turkey, or tilapia or chicken strips, whatever is available or cheapest) or we’ll just go w/o one of the protein and maybe just do a veggie dish or stretch out whatever we already have. Eggs we buy about once a month, we only cook them on our off days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**We almost never buy pre-made meals**, in the beginning I would buy frozen dinners for work and that’s included in this budget. But I would keep them at my work fridge, at home we just cook, eat leftovers or eat out before getting home. Now that I’m working from home, and have a bit more time I do want to learn how to make corn bread and banana bread since we do buy those for quick breakfast and those are easy enough to bake with fairly simple ingredients. I’m also learning how to cut a whole chicken so again I can make stock and learn how to cook more than just chicken breast (idk if I’ll success but we’ll see!).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**We always buy fruit and vegetables**, again we’re creatures of habit. We usually buy the same thing: romaine lettuce, tomatoes, baby carrots, and onion. And in the fruit department we rotate a bit more but we usually always have: apples, tangerine and blueberries (currently we also have kiwi and bananas, yum!). We use the veggies for salad with every meal but also for me to seasoning and we add the fruits to our oatmeal in the morning (yep we buy steel cut oats and just cook it stove top in the morning).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**We shop around a lot**. We do most of our groceries at Aldi (about %80). We also go to our local H-Mart and we just found a nearby Trader Joes near us, those are all our cheap options. We do a ShopRite or Walmart run every once in a while for some specific things. Lastly we do have a Costco membership where we do stock up on dry goods (for instance a 24pck of box almost milk, or 25pds of jasmine rice), but we mostly use Costco for clothes, appliances and household essentials, it does add up in savings even for just the two of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**I season in bulk and rotate!** So for instance, if have ground beef, I usually season the whole thing with my basic seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, Goya), leave half out and freeze the other Half. I can make this weeks ground beef Spanish style with tomatoes, olives, cappers, peppers, cilantro etc and then, next week defrost the remainder and stir fry it with ginger, soy sauce, green onions and carrots. One base seasoning, two different approaches. Same with beans, I boil a pound of dry beans, season it all in a big pot, and divy up what I'll do with it and freeze the rest. Now I only cook about 2-3 time a week, If I’m tired, I know my beef is seasoned and can throw it in the pot, and I can just defrost some beans and put my rice cooker on and have dinner ready in 25min.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**Keep a notepad on the fridge with a running list for when things run out**, I know its common knowledge to always have a shopping list, but it really does work and help curve additional spending!\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**If we can't eat it in a week, we freeze it.** Like just the most random things, you’d be surprise you can freeze. I for instance always freeze my cilantro, parsley and green peppers. Like I mentioned I usually freeze my rice and beans. My boyfriend always freezes hotdogs and bread. Also if there’s a can I didn’t finish off, like of tomatoes paste, I just chuck it in the freezer and next time I need it I run through hot water for a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-**Have an** **Emergency Meal ( a \"911\" like my mom used to call it)**. This is the “I don’t want to lift a finger” meal or the “our fridge is bare but we’re not off until tomorrow to grocery shop” meal. For us it's frozen french fries and frozen jamaican patties, its the only exception to pre-made meal we buy,  we really have gotten into a groove of cooking regularly so it, we only prepare it about 2-3 times a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, these are things I had to learn by trial and error, some may be obvious to the general public, but as someone who just learned to cook, it really wasn’t that obvious to me. Yes we probably had the money to be more liberal with our groceries, but 1. We had a lot of other obligations eating at our budget (no pun intended) so this was an easy place to free up some money. 2. We wanted to build habits that would help us in the future, like when we have kids and our budget will inevitable go up. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\*\\*For those wondering, I got these exact numbers from budgeting with YNAB (You Need a Budget), just went through my year-end reports, so they’re pretty accurate as I track every dollar I spend in the year.\n",

      "Car salesmen here: After reading a thread full of bad info about buying cars from dealerships here is my best advice on how to get the best deal! \n",
      "1) Choose a dealership with a good reputation. Start looking at the backs of cars and seeing which dealership stickers you see the most. Ask friends and family who have bought cars. A dealership does not get a good or bad reputation by accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Don't be a total prick. Eventually down the road you will probably need something from your salesmen. If you were a prick to me I will not show you very good service. Case in point: today I had a customer that was very nice to me come in to have a part installed. Our parts department messed up the order and he got delayed about a month. So when he came in today I filled up his tank for free. If he had been a prick I wouldn't have given him more than 2 minutes of my time- much less a fill up. I also gave him a free oil change. Part of these things come out of my pocket so I am basically just doing something nice to repay his kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Be informed. Know what you are buying. New or used. New: know rebates and try to do fair research on the kinds of markups they have. every dealer has different markups so try to give a relative idea. Used: Look up KBB.com. See what the book is for it (trade in). Know that they PROBABLY paid something around that for it. Add $500 to that and that is a fair price to buy it for.\n",
      "\n",
      "4)Credit unions. They are good if 1) you are buying a used car or 2) you have little or bad credit. When buying new, if you have good credit, credit unions cannot touch dealer financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Ask what your interest rate is. Have an interest rate calculator. Make sure the payments are on par. Use your calculator and subtract 2 points from the rate if it is above a 5% interest. This is the rate you are shooting for. Tell them you want a lower payment without extending months. They can usually work to get a lower rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Try to bargain for fill ups and oil changes/ service contracts. They do not take too much from the salesmen's pockets so they are more apt to giving them out.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Always ask for a Carfax for a used car. If they will not give you one do not do business there.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) There are many benefits to trading- such as saving time, effort, letting someone you do not know drive YOUR car, and you save tax rebates on the amount of your vehicle. 90% of people that I do business trade in their vehicle. It is just easier. For your trade look up KBB.com trade in value of it. If your car has less than 20k miles it is excellent, under 80k good, and anything over is fair. Account for tire replacement and dent repair. If they try to give you a different number than KBB ask to see the book. Book value is usually fair and it is what they have to go by.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Always be nice. We work a job just like you do. The second most people start talking to us they look at us as the enemy. That turns you into a hardened bastard after a while. Being considerate to us goes a very long way- at least to me. Remember that we too have to make a profit- but a fair one. I like to take care of my family just like you do.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) If financing get GAP insurance. It should cost around 400 dollars. Let's say you owe $20,000 on a car and you wreck it. Insurance says it is worth $12,000. Without GAP you are $8,000 fucked. Gap insurance pays that $8,000. I have seen guys leave our dealership totally fucked cause they did not want to pay that one time fee that adds a couple bucks to a payment. It is well worth it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: reading some of your comments is kind of insulting. I know our profession has a bad rap but I was however trying to share helpful tips on how to get the best deal. In turn I've been called some pretty nasty things. To be honest- this is why a lot of car salesmen hate customers more than you all hate us. We are just trying to make a living to provide for our families. Unless you know more than speculation on the ins and outs of this business saying I am a liar, dirty car salesman is just bullshit. The GAP thing came up a lot. It is called INSURANCE for a reason. It is good if you need it. It is damn good. I will put it on my car when I buy one. I do not want to pay for negative equity when I wreck it and total it out- for a car I cannot drive any more- because I was being cheap when I did my paperwork. When we have customers come in and ask for it specifically- it is a good thing.\n",

I buy 5 different types of flour and breadcrumbs and leave them for a year until they're out of date. I spend more than 100$/100euro per week on food, sometimes 150 - that's a lot for one person. Well, not anymore. I'm doing a pantry challenge - which means I plan on eating everything in my cupboard. It's not a sunk cost for me, since I'm alone I really shouldn't need to stockpile.

If unauthorized use occurs before you report it, your liability under federal law depends on how quickly you report the loss.\n",

      "I just switched my personal cell phone service provider from Verizon Wireless where I had a contract with an unlimited data plan, and a few other perks which ended up costing me about $60 a month after I managed to bitch at them enough to get rid of things I really didn't need. With a two year contract this typically meant I could get the newest and neatest phone for some slightly less than ungodly amount of money and then get stuck paying $60 a month for the next two years lest I wish to pay a hefty fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well my contract ran out, so I went and did one of the craziest things I have ever done in my life: I trusted a television advertisement. Virgin Mobile was advertising $35/mo for unlimited data with no contract and they had a pretty decent selection of phones at relatively reasonable prices, and they also don't care if you try and flash over a phone they don't approve of to their service so long as you don't call and ask them for help with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short I paid slightly more than I would have for a comparable Verizon phone (maybe $50 more), and now I pay only $35 a month for cell phone service instead of $60, and have no obligation to do so every month. If I leave the country for a few months, I just don't pay my bill, and simply resume paying it when I get back. The data is indeed unlimited, only catch is after 3.5gb they start to limit your bandwidth. If you keep wifi on, I don't see how you can exceed that without making an active effort to do so. The most expensive plan, which included unlimited everything (minutes and data), was $55 a month.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) Husband has agreed to an allowance for his hobbies and personal luxuries. That amount will be direct deposited into his checking and the remainder of his paycheck will be deposited into the joint checking (he has submitted this request to HR, though it might take a paycheck or two before it actually happens. He knows that the amount he agreed to is a cut from where he has been spending. He says it's smart to make him have to learn the reasonable limit, and that his spending as a single 39-year old probably needs adjustment now that he's a married 40-year old with a spouse and new joint goals together.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) This year's comic book purchases aren't in the storage unit. They're in his closet here at the apartment. We're going to sort the ones that are here, and new purchases will be kept sorted moving forward (he's buying the white storage boxes today for this task). Once his house sells and we buy a new house, we'll make sure the new house has a dedicated space to comics storage and display (so we can eliminate the storage unit).\\*\\*\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) We're going to read the back issues digitally for the Spider Gwen comics this month (since the first couple years of those issues are buried somewhere in the storage unit, and too difficult to access right now). Then together we're going to read the new ones as they come out -- hopefully so I'm more invested in the collection, and it gives us both motivation to keep the new incoming issues organized.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows it's not that it's comics that bothers me. I couldn't care less what he was into specifically. It's that he's spending a disproportionate amount of the discretionary spending on something that I don't see him enjoying, and it's preventing us from not only letting me spend an equal amount on my hobbies/pasttimes, but it's preventing us from reaching our joint goals. But, now that we've agreed to his allowance for hobby spending, it's gonna be up to him to make sure he's setting aside enough each month to pay for his comicon trips and the other bigger goals he has with his hobbies. So the specific amount spent on comics isn't really going to be an issue, hopefully, as long as he keeps his overall hobby spending to fit his allowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you all again for the comments/insight/thoughts/encouragement/etc. It helps me to read a variety of perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*\\*This actually was an interesting conversation which I think hit home for him to hammer in that his spending on the comics was not proportional to the role it played in his life. We were sitting in the tv/AV room, and I pointed to the DVDs and such and asked how much he thinks we spend on DVDs, Netflix, etc. $200/month at most? Ok, sure. $200. We have an entire room, maybe 80-100 square feet solely devoted to the use and enjoyment of a hobby/pasttime we spend $200/month on. He spends 5x that much on comics. Do we have any space in the apartment devoted to it? If he spends, let's say, 60 hours/month watching movies and streaming shows (on which we spend $200/month or whatever), how many hours per month are we devoting to comics (on which we spend $1000/month)? 1 hour, if that? Then I pointed to the kitchen. How much per month do we spend on food and kitchen stuff? (Less than we spend on his comics.) How many square feet of the apartment is devoted to it? (It's a very small kitchen, maybe 50 square feet.) How much time per month do we spend on making food, mixing cocktails, making coffee, eating food, etc.? I mean, I know it's not a direct correlation, but this exercise seemed to at least communicate what I found frustrating about his comic collection, and it made sense to him.\n",
