        Leftover pizza
        üçé Food
        Probably not the most frugal but helpful tip:

        whenever we order pizza we intentionally order large and just freeze whatever slices we don‚Äôt eat. then when we don‚Äôt have time and are super hungry and busy we just pop the slices we wanna rest in the toaster oven.

        important to store in freezer safe bags or containers. And try to eat within the first 3 months.

        We also freeze lasagna as when making it we usually make too much for just 2/4 people. i do the same with rice and it‚Äôs a great kickstarter for quick meals like fried rice or egg drop soups with rice.

    Is there something you would buy for yourself if you had 1k to spend in whatever you like?
Discussion üí¨
My wife and I sold a house that increased its value over time. We are using most of the money to pay debt and a house down payment but we also decided to spend $1,000 each in anything we want.

This is not very frugal but I realized that I‚Äôve been frugal for so long that I lost the will to buy something for myself. I feel like I don‚Äôt need anything right now and I feel guilty just by thinking about spending it.

Have you been in a similar situation?
