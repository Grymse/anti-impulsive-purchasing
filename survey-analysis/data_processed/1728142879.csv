1f8x4d5,Alozaps,1725465922,(Canada) Fast Food Coupon Observation,"This pertains to Canada, but the concept is similar in other countries.

I've gotten new mailer coupons for Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's, and I want to highlight something I noticed. Wendy's and Burger King both have 2-can-dine combo deals for $15.69. The McDonald's 2-can-dine is $17.78 (over $2 more), even though it's less filling and doesn't taste as good as the other two. Plus, at a place like Wendy's, you can swap the drink in a combo for a satisfying Frosty, while the substitution options at McDonald's are poor in comparison.

I'm not saying Wendy's and Burger King are cheap (fast food is not cheap in general), but I'm just perplexed as to why McDonald's prices are more expensive than other fast food joints. What justifies that? Why would anyone who is not completely ignorant about their options go to McD's over other places?

In my area, the McDonald's locations are always the dirtiest and have the most unsavory people hanging around them. They are outclassed in every way by other fast food places. So, I struggle to see a good reason why McDonald's shouldn't just collapse aside from brand recognition and a long history of being in business.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1f8x4d5/canada_fast_food_coupon_observation/,21,0.81,7,frugal,/r/Frugal/comments/1f8x4d5/canada_fast_food_coupon_observation/,üçé Food ,,1725538056.0,False,False,True,False,False,1728142879,False

1fmskf3,1042Mary,1727009562,Cheap ‚Äúemergency‚Äù meals that aren‚Äôt fast food,"I was just reading a post about why many of us still eat fast food even though it‚Äôs not the most frugal option, and it seemed like the most cited reason was lack of time to cook a meal at home. Friends, I hear you! I used to be a SAHM, but inflation has forced me back to work, and I am shocked by how much less time I have for cooking and meal prep. I am also equally reluctant to see my new paycheck get eaten up by convenience foods. I also have ADHD, so anything that is going to require regular dedicated planning is not going to work for me. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing to avoid eating out most weeks!

I do meal plan every Sunday, but with a twist: I assume at least three nights a week will be leftovers, so I only need to think of four dinners each week. Then I only plan one breakfast and one lunch, because we‚Äôre usually fine with eating the same thing every week for those meals.

For days when I am overextended or just over exhausted, I keep what I call ‚Äúemergency meals‚Äù on hand‚Äîthings like:
- Ramen that can be dressed up with a drizzle of sesame oil and frozen veggies
- Canned soups that I know my kids like
- Pasta that can be served with butter, olive oil, dried garlic and herbs
- Frozen chicken nuggets and fries
- Pita pizzas‚ÄîI generally have a big bag of shredded mozzarella and pizza sauce in the fridge

I may not have ALL of the above at any given time, but when I do my weekly meal planning, I do make sure I have at least one emergency meal on hand.

Also, I do splurge on prepackaged snacks, nuts, and fruit that I can grab and bring in the car when I know we‚Äôre going to be out and about around meal time. Yes, this is more expensive then buying in bulk and portioning myself, but I do not have time for that, and doing it this way is still cheaper than eating out and also reduces the temptation to eat out because I already have food in the car. (We also bring our water bottles everywhere because I ain‚Äôt paying $4 each for convenience hydration).

What are some of your favorite hacks for avoiding eating out when you‚Äôre crunched for time and sanity?

EDIT TO ADD: I think many have missed that I said *emergency* food. What I listed is not what we eat every day. It‚Äôs what we eat when I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to make something else and saves us from spending on takeout.

ADDITIONAL EDIT: There are so many good ideas on here! Thank you all for the suggestions. This has blown up, so I‚Äôm not able to respond to everything, but I am loving learning from you all.

1fuwhpw,ajkewl245a,1727918990,WalMart+ Has Been More Hassle Than It's Worth,"I canceled my Amazon Prime membership last year and switched to WalMart+.  They have most of what I need to get online and I can get groceries delivered, so I figured it would be a better fit.

I was wrong.

The WalMart+ service has been nothing short of terrible.  Half of the time, my groceries are delivered late (they ask you for a 2 hour window when you want them delivered), and I have to change my plans.  Sometimes my packages are delivered to the wrong apartment, sometimes to the wrong building entirely.  Sometimes they claim that they can't find the building (it's an 11 floor apartment building with giant numbers on the front, and Amazon, UPS, FedEx, and DHL never have issues delivering).  Sometimes I order something to be shipped from the warehouse and they tell me that they can't because it's not available at the local store, which is irrelevant.  I specifically asked for it to be shipped from the warehouse because that's where they said that they had the item, but they switched it to the store delivery and then tell me that they don't have it?  What's that about?

I placed a grocery order on Saturday for groceries to be delivered on Sunday between 7A-9A.  At 9:30A, I contacted support to find out where they were, since I had to leave the house by 10:30A.  They said that the driver had returned to the store.  I wasn't notified, I wasn't given any information.  I asked them to cancel the order and refund my money and they said that they would.  I checked today, and the order is still showing as ""delayed,"" so I contacted support again.  They said that I have to wait another 24 hours to request a refund.  I've already bought all of the groceries that were in that order, and now I'm wasting time going back and forth with support, trying to get a refund.

I'm very tempted to do a chargeback on this purchase.  

So, if you're thinking about getting WalMart+ to save some money, you will definitely save some money.

This is a hack if your car takes, and/or runs better on 89 octane (mid-grade)gas. 
In CA, many stations 3 grades of gas 87,89,91 octane. However, very few, if any, sell gas at a price lower than Costco.
So if you have a Costco gas station, not too out of the way, and you need 89 octane gas because your car requires higher octane, but don‚Äôt want to pay the sometimes $.40-$.50/gal difference in 87 vs 91 that Costco charges, Just fill 1/2 with 87 and other 1/2 with 91.

Basically you pay $10 a year as a base rate, then if you need to use the drop in daycare - say you just need a self care day, or you've got a billion errands to run, you can drop off up to four children for 6 hours for a total of $25. They also offer half days between $7 to $20 (depending the # of children you need care for). 

This centre also offers parenting classes and ateliers to address sibling rivalry, child orthophonics, support fathers in expressing fatherhood whether they be primary caregivers, step fathers etc. Daycare for the children is free while parents (or siblings) attend classes.

If it's just going to happen again, I don't see the point of replacing the current chair.    
  
I picked this model because it's a balance between the weight capacity and the price. A lot of office chairs out there have a puny weight limit of 250 lbs or less, so I can't consider them.   
I also don't order stuff online (that's a whole conversation I won't get into), so I'm limited to buying from local stores.

1f9hawv,PopsMCG,1725524404,"I'm 24, Financially Struggling and at a Pivotal Point.","Hey everyone, I‚Äôm at a bit of a crossroads right now, trying to figure out my financial path. For some context, I‚Äôm 24, married, work in IT, and do a little Twitch streaming on the side. I know it sounds like a mix of different things!

My wife and I have had our share of ups and downs with money. We get to a point where we think we‚Äôre finally set to save up, but then life throws us a curveball‚Äîlike moving, bills piling up, or me switching jobs.

Right now, we‚Äôve got about $7,700 saved up. With my next two paychecks, we should be just under $10k once we cover bills and everything. I know there are folks out there in tougher situations who can‚Äôt even hit $1k saved up (been there myself), so I‚Äôm trying to stay grounded and make the most of what we‚Äôve got.

We‚Äôve been trying to save up for a house, and we even found one we‚Äôre interested in about 30 minutes away. But, of course, I‚Äôm worried our car might break down or that winter will bring extra challenges. My question is, what should I do? I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äúmoney doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù kind of guy, trying to help out as many people as I can if I have the means, even if it means skipping out on small treats like a $5 coffee or donut for myself.

So, here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at: Should I invest in something? If so, what? Should we go ahead and purchase this house we‚Äôre interested in, despite the added driving distance and potential increase in bills? Or should we keep renting for now? Maybe even get a second job? Honestly, I‚Äôm tired and just want a stable place where we can stay for more than a year, with a roof over our heads and decent food.

If we do have to move, I want it to be the last time. It‚Äôs not fair to my wife that we have to keep relocating and chasing different job opportunities. She‚Äôs incredibly supportive and loving, but she finds it challenging to secure work, which makes everything even harder. Am I asking for too much?

Any feedback would mean the world to her and I

EDIT: Just for reference at the previous job where I was at for a few months I as making 65k a year, full benefits, wife was making roughly 26k a year, so totaling out to 91K before taxes.

1exigtd,Alternative-Ad4581,1724221376,Why Are Flights and Meals the Same Price? Am I the Only One Confused by This?,"
I've been thinking about how strange it is that the cost of things doesn't always make sense. For example, I recently went to a restaurant where one dish was $20 plus tips, and a single drink was $17 plus tips. By the time you factor in everything, one person is easily spending around $100 for a meal. Meanwhile, I can buy a nice pair of sneakers for $100 that will last me a long time, and I personally value them way more than a single meal.

What really gets me is that I can often find a flight for around $100 as well. It seems bizarre that a meal, which is a one-time experience, costs the same as a flight, which takes you to a whole new place, or a pair of sneakers, which could last me for months or years. How did we get to this point where a meal and a flight cost the same?

Has anyone else felt this way? How do you justify spending on experiences versus things that have lasting value? I'd love to hear how others think about this, especially in today's economy where it seems like the price of everything is going up.

1fc1m3u,Junel_Fe,1725812339,How do I find Epson Printer Ink as cheap as possible?,"Hello everyone. I have an Epson XP-4105 printer that takes ""212"" ink cartridges. The printer comes in handy when I need to print personal things, but what always gets me is the price of the ink. The black ink alone costs $20 for a regular size, and for 212XL, it costs nearly $40. That's outrageous to me, and the color cartridges can be $40 for the regular size while the color XL costs into the $60 price range. It's all too much.

I've heard of people getting third-party ink cartridges for printers, but I don't want to end up wrecking my printer and wasting money in the process because it suddenly decides it doesn't want to accept the third-party ink.

For Epson printer ink, where are the most affordable places that I can go to get my ink cartridges? I was thinking OfferUp might be one place, but I'm wary of buying secondhand from there in case it's already partially used or gets busted during shipment. Maybe Facebook marketplace would be better?

I've done some calculations however, and noticed I'm only getting around 30-40g of protein per day. I would like to get it up to at least 80g so I have one gram per kg of body weight.

What is the most affordable way to do this? My first thought was protein powder, but to get 50g of protein I would need to eat 2 servings per day. Meaning that it would cost an additional 54 euro per month at 0.9 euro per serving. This is not economically viable for me unless I cut back on a lot of other expenses.

My second thought was beans. 200g of dry beans contain 42g of protein and cost 0.8 euro. Meaning it would cost 24 euro per month to get almost the same amount of protein. The upside is that 200g beans contain 700 kcal, so I would need to eat less other food. The downside is that beans really upset my stomach and give me painful bloating even with small amounts. Another downside is that they need to be soaked for several hours before cooking, and I don't enjoy the taste or texture.

1f653si,jjjjennieeee,1725161394,"PSA: If you have a car, Take Advantage of Free Check Engine Light and Free Battery and Alternator Checks (and sometimes Free Battery Installation)Services","I thought this sub would appreciate my story since I likely wasted money today, and foolishly so.

Yesterday, when I attempted to start my car again after work to meet friends for a movie night, it wouldn't start. No worries, I have a handy and portable battery jump starter that I purchased from Costco and that worked to start my car.

I knew most service departments would be closed or closing soon, but being mindful of the Labor Day Weekend, I called a few shops that I have used before (so I trusted them) anyway to see if they would be open this holiday weekend. The few that were still open and picked up the phone informed me that unfortunately they would be closed or that they were fully booked.

I told my friends I wouldn't be able to make movie night since I didn't want to risk driving a car somewhere unnecessary before replacing failed parts, and I just stayed home to look up possible service coupons and found one for free labor for battery replacement and went to bed early. I had no plans for today, but I had plans for Sunday and I need to work on Monday but most service shops said they would resume business on Tuesday so I kept that info in the back of my mind.

The next day (aka today) when I woke up, I luckily remembered that O'Reilly's and AutoZone both do free battery testing and can install a new car battery for you for free, so I called my local shop, they looked up my car model and told me that for my specific car it's recommended that a professional install the new car battery so unfortunately they couldn't install it for me for free. I started to panic a bit because I was banking on O'Reilly's to be my simple solution, and so I called a different local shop to confirm, and then asked them for a recommended service center that would be open over Labor Day Weekend. They gave me a couple of recommendations.

This is where my brain went crazy. I knew that if I would need to jump start my car each time I wanted to turn it on since the first jump start didn't help the battery work more than once. But since the car was able to run after jump starting the car I didn't even think I'd have an alternator issue. I was also worried why my check engine light was coming on instead of the battery light. I thought it would be inconvenient to have to stop by O'Reilly's to buy a car battery and then jump start my car again to turn it on to then stop by their recommended service shops to have the battery installed for me so I had asked them if I could go directly to the service center, and they said yes, they can deliver the battery directly to the shop for free and it's part of their service model.

My car needed a new battery before around the same number of years as now (each battery seemed to last about 4 years), so I didn't think much about that and thought the problem was the battery. The service rep had already shown to be a bit shady (he initially said $35 for installing the car battery and then tried to go up on that price) and told me he saw I had engine issues and he could charge me $150 for a check engine test (he tried to claim other places would charge more for that) and I said no thanks to that.

After the new battery was installed, the car seemed to start normally, but I had enough time to wait for the battery to be delivered that luckily my brain kicked in to working mode again, so I drove straight to O'Reilly's to ask for the free check engine light assessment as well as to check the new battery and do an alternator test.

They confirmed the alternator has 1 issue. They said the check engine light was likely related to the battery/alternator issue since the message only read a low voltage issue.

After I drove the car for a bit the check engine light went away. But, if the alternator still has an issue that needs to be fixed, a part of me feels really foolish for not going to O'Reilly's first to learn this -- maybe there was no problem with my battery to begin with and they could have tested that to rule out that being a part of the issue so save me the cost of a new battery. Now I will never know (I don't plan on going back to the shady shop to ask for my old battery back to get it tested).

I'll wait until Tuesday when the shops I trust reopen after the holiday to schedule an alternator replacement. Ugh, why do these things always happen at the worst times, right?

TLDR: Don't make the mistake of panicking if you can help it.... and don't forget that your local chain auto parts shops have a free service to test battery, alternator, starter, and check engine light issues for you, and they can even install windshield wipers, headlight bulbs, and some car batteries for free for you. This could save you money over going to a service center. I've used their free windshield installation services before which was great since I had trouble popping out my old windshield wipers once.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1f653si/psa_if_you_have_a_car_take_advantage_of_free/,21,0.73,28,frugal,/r/Frugal/comments/1f653si/psa_if_you_have_a_car_take_advantage_of_free/,üöó Auto ,,1725165692.0,False,False,True,False,False,1728142879,False

I had never budgeted my groceries before and honestly I‚Äôm not really trying??? I‚Äôm really confused because a lot of people say they spend that amount in a week and still struggle.

I never buy anything premade because cooking has become a big hobby of mine, so I guess that‚Äôs why? Sometimes I get ice cream or chips, but I‚Äôm assuming that because I like to make literally *everything* from scratch (granola bars, salsas) and I don‚Äôt buy a ton of animal products (I try to be environmentally friendly with my food!) 

 I even buy some organic stuff‚Ä¶ and eat like x4 a day‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt get it but I guess it‚Äôs a win 

And yes I‚Äôve tripled checked. The grocery store I go to doesn‚Äôt have Apple Pay and so I can only use one of my cards to shop there, and I don‚Äôt go anywhere else for groceries. Easy to track it all for the month. Checked all categories.

EDIT: answering common questions! I am a small woman, and Im not lifting weights (but I‚Äôd still say im not a total couch potato!). I live alone. 

I did not intend to make my monthly total sound like a brag. To be honest, I‚Äôm just shocked because I have heard so much about the rise in cost of groceries. The whole reason I never checked my monthly total is because I was scared to even look at it. I‚Äôm happy to have gotten some reassurance that some other folks also live on this total. 

I can‚Äôt accurately say how much I spend cooking and planning meals because I‚Äôve never paid attention to that. I might post my shopping list and some recipes next time I do a big shop.

I am a commuting student in college and I often spend 12-14 hours a day on campus, at the gym, at my lab, or traveling to and from. I'm having trouble eating on a budget when I am only home for maybe one meal a day (breakfast). 

Most days I will pack lunch, but then 6 pm rolls around and I'm still out doing stuff and I'm very, very hungry. I'm not sure how to eat on a very tight budget when options like ""cook at home"" aren't always the most realistic. I've just been going hungry because I can't afford to eat out for dinner/snacks. 

P.S: I do not have access to a fridge at school, so anything I pack has to either go in a cooler in my car or be shelf stable.

If you live in hotter states that murder your battery, always sign up for Auto Zone or any of your local auto shops‚Äô exchange policy if they have one.

This was until I started exchanging them at AutoZone.

As long as you have an account, and the battery is getting exchanged within 3 years, you pay literally a tax for a new battery. I exchanged mine this morning, where it was an August ‚Äò22 battery, and I paid $3.77 for it. A $290 battery completely free, basically.

An important distinction and I wasn't thinking when I wrote the latter. Either way, I'm not looking for people to tell me I'm a dumb dumb for spending my money on it. I (probably unnecessarily) added it for context. 

  
ORIGINAL POST: I (F34) am generally good about not spending on things I don't need. The only things I spend a lot on are groceries and OOP health expenses.

The health expenses are a necessity. I have some autoimmune stuff going on that only \*naturopathic\* care has been able to help with. It costs a couple thousand dollars a year OOP but at least I'm feeling better than before because of it.

The groceries situation is something I have more control over. It's a necessity for me to eat healthy, but I'm still on the fence about how worth it paying a premium for organic and farm stand food is. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and have read all sorts of perspectives on whether or not organic/farm fresh makes that much of a difference. The difference in cost could but upwards of $100-$200/month if I committed to going all organic/farm. Right now I only buy a few things organic/farm fresh.

I'm curious how you approach this in your own lives and whether you've noticed a marked difference in switching between organic/farm fresh versus not.

I got a $4/hr raise at work so I think I will buy my first car.

My last credit score from TransUnion was 684, but I have recently increased my credit card limit by $900 and decreased my utilization by about $2,000, and I‚Äôm hoping to see these changes reflected in my credit reports soon.

I understand the election may influence car prices, but do you think it will make a big enough difference to justify waiting?

I work from home but would like to have a car for increased independence and because Ubers are unreliable and expensive.

The car I believe I want to buy is a Toyota Camry Hybrid; that is, if I decide to get a new vehicle.

[Should I get a used car instead?]

Toyota because the brand appears to be super reliable, Camry because I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs less noisy than a Corolla, and Hybrid because I think it will cost less overall. I‚Äôm also concerned about what gas prices will do in the next few years.

I really know very little about cars and especially buying cars, but I am a hardass when it comes to getting a great deal.

Dealers are renowned for ripping people off, so I thought about buying online (not from a third party tho). Do y‚Äôall think this is a good idea?

I want a good warranty and a car that will not need maintenance every few weeks or days. I want an easy driving experience with a monthly payment I can afford comfortably.

So, what do I need to know, and can you explain it to me like I‚Äôm five?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1f92nkp/need_carbuying_help_first_time/,1,1.0,2,frugal,/r/Frugal/comments/1f92nkp/need_carbuying_help_first_time/,üöó Auto ,,False,False,False,True,False,False,1728142879,True

1flz9qg,WanderingSongbird,1726911361,How frugal can I get?,"Here‚Äôs the story:
27F single, living in Paris.
Take home 2,800‚Ç¨/m but pay about 700‚Ç¨ for rent and 607‚Ç¨ for a loan repayment every month.

Recent changes that I consider ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù
1. I changed my phone plan and pay 20‚Ç¨ a month now instead of 30‚Ç¨. That‚Äôs a 120‚Ç¨ savings every year.
2. I quit ballet which costed 22‚Ç¨ a class, and I was going quite a bit. Now I joined my local triathlons club for 400‚Ç¨/year which is close to 35‚Ç¨ a month if you break it down, which means I‚Äôm making a huge savings because I can go to as many training sessions as I want. It‚Äôs also a social activity, unlike ballet where I was very much in my own little bubble. And the ROI in terms of getting in shape is much higher than ballet. 
3. Instead of doing 40‚Ç¨/ hour singing lessons 1-2 a month, I tried out for choir and got in. We meet every week for 2 hours, and it‚Äôs 85‚Ç¨ for the semester, so you can easily do the math. In just one session with the choir, it‚Äôs like I would have paid for 2 singing lessons. Of course, I don‚Äôt get one-on-one training, but I get to practice in a social setting and learn with others. It‚Äôs a great opportunity and seems frugal to me! I also told myself, instead of paying ‚Ç¨40 every other Tuesday for a singing lesson, what if I just blocked that time in my calendar and came home and did YouTube lessons for an hour? That‚Äôs FREE! 
4.  I get 6 weeks of groceries for a total of 66‚Ç¨. That‚Äôs 11‚Ç¨/week and it often can make about 10 meals depending on what‚Äôs in the vegetable box. This is through a program with my old university (thankfully they allow alumni to continue profiting from the veggie baskets!). It‚Äôs local and organic, amazing quality, and cheap. This is saving me from expensive grocery store visits, which would cost me anywhere from 20-40‚Ç¨ per visit. I still have to go about 1-2x a week for weekend food and other basics, but what a deal!!!
5. And finally, I shop for my clothes on Vinted. But the issue here is that sometimes I spend more than I realize I‚Äôve spent - so I‚Äôm putting a pause on that. I removed my debit card so I can‚Äôt make purchases with my eyes closed, so to speak. The problem is that sometimes you just don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to fit (especially with shoes) so purchases here are kind of a hit-or-miss situation.  I‚Äôm almost thinking that it‚Äôs better just to invest in nice clothes I know will last in the long term.

Those are things I imagine will pay off in the long term, and bring me lots of joy. What about you? What are you doing?

1fba0cu,senoritagordita22,1725724136,Was doing great w/ savings and frugality til I had to buy prescription sunglasses‚Ä¶ ,"(Respectfully, I will lose my sh*t if someone comments suggesting zenni again. At least read the whole post if you‚Äôre gonna comment pleaseüò≠ü§£)

My eyes are sh*t. I have contacts, but wear glasses to work for my desk job. So on the drive there and back, I have to choose either blurry vision w/ sunglasses or the sun blinding me w/ my regular glasses. 

I‚Äôve been planning to get prescription sunglasses for months and finally went in. I‚Äôm sure there are cheaper places, but since my vision is so bad I only go to the highly acclaimed eye clinic in my town. 

I was expecting them to be $500ish. 

It was $980. 

I took from my emergency savings and will get more side hustles to pay it back but holy shit. I still have a safe amount in my savings, I just didn‚Äôt expect to have to borrow against it was the shocker. 

Mainly just venting. I know at the end of the day good vision while driving is worth minimising likelihood of  an accident, but just felt like a punch in the gut that I‚Äôd been doing so well and a necessity did this much damage. 

And next time I‚Äôm job hunting I will be filtering by vision insurance ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 

Copying and pasting a comment bc people are suggesting online/Zennis: 

No because I have a very wonky prescription + astigmatism + strabismus+ depth perception/eyes working together issues. Like my actual eyesight (like reading without my glasses) is fine ish there‚Äôs just a billion other things that make it wonky. So I go to this place cause they are the best in their field and the quality is insane

Like people go overseas to get eye surgery done here (my friend works at the surgery dept lol)

(And other people on here have commented confirming zenni isn‚Äôt good for some prescription situations.)

If I had regular bad eyesight I would do that, but I have weird bad eyesight, so I will choose the absolute best for safety. 

To me also frugality is understanding where you should be frugal and where you shouldn‚Äôt for the long term benefits. I‚Äôll have these bad boys for the rest of my life hopefully&$900 is cheaper than a car accident on sunny days!

On Tuesdays, I go to Jack in the Box and get 2 free tacos with any purchase so I get 4 tacos for $1 plus tax.

On Wednesdays, I go to Wendy‚Äôs for 6 free nuggets with any purchase and get the small chicken sandwich loaded with tomato, pickle, and onion for $2 plus tax. I also have a Frosty key tag that I paid $2 or $4 for last year that gets me a free Frosty as well.

On Thursdays, McDonald‚Äôs does a random free item with purchase so I get 2 McChickens for $3 or 1 for $1.80 and the free item has been a happy meal, 10 piece nuggets, double cheeseburger, etc.

On Fridays, I go back to Wendy‚Äôs and get a free any size fries for the same $2 that I get the chicken sandwich for and add the free Frosty to that.

On Fridays, McDonald‚Äôs, Jack in the Box, and Burger King also do free fries with any purchase. In fact, Burger King has free any size fries with purchase everyday!

I also get random offers here and there like this week Arbys is doing a free Gyro with purchase so I get the happy hour $1 slider and get a full meal for $1 plus tax.

There are other apps too like Taco Bell and pretty much every fast food place that will have special offers here and there to get me stuff on the other days. If there are literally no offers, I use the points for a free small sandwich that I accumulate while getting the other offers and spending a dollar or two for past transactions.

My van just broke down and it‚Äôs probably going to cost me about 3k to fix but there are other vans of the same make and model out there on Facebook marketplace for even cheaper than the repairs (this isn‚Äôt including the cost of insurance and how much it would cost me to register my new vehicle). I‚Äôm currently living off of like $1 to $3 dollars a day and still staying in the van until I can find the replacement part I need.

1f9qeqs,SimplifyAndAddCoffee,1725553025,What are the best long-shelf-life frugal foods to stockpile for emergencies?,"Trying to build a better stockpile of food for emergencies, as always stuff does expire and go bad, some things sooner than others... and as a frugal shopper, often deals involve foods already close to expiration. 

What are some things which offer the best nutrition per dollar, and also keep the longest (several years)?

EDIT: to clarify, I'm aware of the general advice of dry foods, rice, grains, beans, legumes, etc... what I'm really hoping to find is comprehensive resources on nutritional completeness of various preservable foods, their maximum preservation times, and combinations of foods to compliment or supplement each other on a long time scale. 

Or the next best thing: suggestions for less commonly thought about food options which can fill a niche in a survival pantry. e.g. instant grits can last 25+ years when stored properly and supply calcium and iron etc...

are there any good sources of vitamin C that can keep long term?

P.S. yes I am aware that you should rotate out stock of things you can eat and not just sit on it until it goes bad. I'm hoping to find inspiration to start including some more long-term preservable foods in my diet as a part of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1f9qeqs/what_are_the_best_longshelflife_frugal_foods_to/,39,0.86,96,frugal,/r/Frugal/comments/1f9qeqs/what_are_the_best_longshelflife_frugal_foods_to/,üçé Food ,,1725642235.0,False,False,True,False,False,1728142879,True

Thinking about getting back into working remotely. Currently I live i company provided housing at a rent of $1,200 a month in an area that while I don't mind it, I have no ties to outside of my current job. Looking to cut that down as much as possible. Preferably in something furnished and short term (like a motel or AirBNB). I can't find anything under like $1,000 a month. There's gotta be some random rentals in some random small town that would fit. I just don't know where to find them.

1fr6urx,Realistic-Inside5203,1727499448,When did you realize frugal living is the way to live?,"For me? When I finally feel peace.

I‚Äôve been working since I was 20 and now that I am 27, the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck still continues. It was exhausting and I get anxious a lot specially 3 days before my payday cause I am running on a tight budget by then.

The statement ‚Äúyour salary won‚Äôt fix your spending issues‚Äù applied to someone like me. I know I am earning enough and can save a substantial amount if I try, but I don‚Äôt.

I have this impression that frugal living is not the way to live, budgeting is stressful and that I can save money without ‚Äúbudgeting‚Äù. Obviously that didn‚Äôt work for someone who is like me - emotional spender.

Lucky for me, I eventually got tired of that anxiety  feeling of living paycheck to paycheck.

So I got my shit together, I started budgeting.

And to my surprise, it is actually fun. I also started following the 20% bracket for savings but because I am so passionate on being frugal and sticking to my budget. I re-computed my budget, and I realize, I can actually save 50% of my income.


And even by this, I can still make allowance for things I truly enjoy, I found ways to enjoy my weekend too without spending much like visiting a library, going to parks with my packed lunch etc.

Wow I didn‚Äôt know being Frugal is this fun and peaceful. Imagine my surprise.
