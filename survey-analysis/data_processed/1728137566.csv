1eb55gt,Flack_Bag,1721836984,Why we don't allow brand recommendations,"A lot of people seem to have problems with this rule. It's been explained before, but we're overdue for a reminder.

This is an anticonsumerism sub, and a core part of anticonsumerism is analyzing and criticizing advertising and branding campaigns. And a big part of building brand recognition is word of mouth marketing. For reasons that should be obvious, that is not allowed here.

Obviously, even anticonsumerists sometimes have to buy commercial products, and the best course is to make good, conscious choices based on your personal priorities. This means choosing the right product and brand.

Unfortunately, asking for recommendations from internet strangers is not an effective tool for making those choices.

When we've had rule breaking posts asking for brand recommendations, a couple very predictable things happen:

1.   Well-meaning users who are vulnerable to greenwashing and other social profiteering marketing overwhelm the comments, all repeating the marketing messages from those companies' advertising campaigns . Most of these campaigns are deceptive to some degree or another, some to the point of being false advertising, some of which have landed the companies in hot water from regulators.

2.   Not everyone here is a well meaning user. We also have a fair number of paid shills, drop shippers, and others with a vested interest in promoting certain products. And some of them work it in cleverly enough that others don't realize that they're being advertised to.

Of course, scattered in among those are going to be a handful of good, reliable personal recommendations. But to separate the wheat from the chaff would require extraordinary efforts from the moderators, and would still not be entirely reliable. All for something that is pretty much counter to the intent of the sub.

And this should go without saying, but don't try to skirt the rule by describing a brand by its tagline or appearance or anything like that.

That said, those who are looking for specific brand recommendations have several other options for that.

Depending on your personal priorities, the subreddits /r/zerowaste and /r/buyitforlife allow product suggestions that align with their missions. Check the rules on those subs before posting, but you may be able to get some suggestions there.

If you're looking for a specific type of product, you may want to search for subreddits about those products or related interests. Those subs are far more likely to have better informed opinions on those products. (Again, read their rules first to make sure your post is allowed.)

If you still have questions or reasonable complaints, post them here, not in the comments of other posts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1eb55gt/why_we_dont_allow_brand_recommendations/,493,0.96,29,anticonsumption,/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1eb55gt/why_we_dont_allow_brand_recommendations/,,,False,False,False,True,False,True,1728137566,False

1fwhf02,Mr_McGuggins,1728099014,"Ads are increasingly prevalent, and there's very few ways to avoid many of them. ","There is now an absurd number of ads everywhere and there's increasingly 0 way to avoid them.

For instance, a local radio station has almost completely replaced the artist/channel name text with ads for an auto accident lawyer. It started with the occasional one during ads, then every few minutes, then it eventually got to the point where it'd flash channel, song name, then stay on the ad for multiple minutes. Even the picture it somehow was broadcasting would be replaced with the logo of a law firm. There is 0 way to avoid this other than never listen to that again with one of those new radios. 

There's ford's patent to read and display billboards, rokus attempts to display ads over inputs, roku, the sony patent to make tvs that require yelling the brand name to dismiss ads, the Sony patent to pause games to display ad breaks, the sony patent on ads that force you to interact with an ad to end it (like flicking a pickle onto a burger), the Ford patent to essentially listen in to the car and put ads on the infotainment machine so on and so forth. It's likely not improving. For heavens sake, they're selling tvs with dedicated second screens JUST FOR ADS, complete with sensors mics and cameras presumably to really dial in the ads. To make it worse, the second screen (according to my limited research) is also chained to the TV controls. 

Now, while I am hopeful someone will come up with a bypass to send the ad systems straight to the curb (or even jailbreak the ad systems for use for something), I can't really say that's going to save us. Even the biggest brains can't really hacksmith their way out of this. No, instead the issue is that companies are like monkeys. Greedy, money hungry, monkeys. Monkey see, and monkey do. And these companies are in fact seeing. 

The TV example is interesting. It started with rokus ad filled sticks, then smart TV operating systems, then the realization that ""if I ad this, I could make money too!"" Led to every company save for a few now selling smart ad enabled tvs. This gave a few psychopaths some bad ideas, and the telly TV was born, with ads baked in, a whole host of data collection, and a second ads only screen. 

That's the way every ad based technology will head. Why? Ads make money. And while most people would smack someone silly for proposing the dual ad TV or the say name to shut the ad off, companies aren't run with ""most people"" at the wheel. At this point, the only ads I'm cool with are car badges. Thats because I want to know what model your car is, it looks cool. 

How do we get around it? We sort of don't. Even the smallest tvs for example ship more and more often with roku or Amazon operating systems, and cars and radios have been shipping with text radios for years. The best bet is:

-Adblocker
-Dns or router based ad blocker 
-Very specific hardware hacking/firmware replacements
-Luck

Unfortunately, ads aren't going away, and the worst part is that in 20 years, nobody will even know or care about the ads. They'll be so normal and ingrained that ads everywhere to future people will be as normal as clouds or the sun. I saw an ad at an old 50s diner the other day too. 

If anyone has better ideas though, please share them. I'd like to know how to disable the crap out of a roku TV with ads and laugh right in it's stupid face.

1fvtngt,Basdoderth,1728027369,Any advice on how to stop an obsession with upgrading?,"Hi. I'm sorry for the long post. I just need to vent. 

 It's quite hard for me to stop thinking about upgrading my tech. 

I was always a geek and I couldn't afford anything when I was a child and a teen so now that I have an income I feel like buying high end cellphones and informatics gadgets is like treating me. 

But you know how this works. I bought a cellphone and not even a year later its upgraded version released into the market. 

My phone is perfect but I constantly get into this three-hours-or-more night sessions where I get obsessed and try to think of ways to upgrade and keep looking at reviews and prices.

I've upgraded three times in the last 2 years. I had 2 cellphones during six months till I got tired and nauseated. 

I got myself into debt and financial stress because of this (I don't make a lot) and because this happens with other tech. At one point I had 3 computers in my power supposedly to compare them but luckily I returned 2 and got refunded. But I thought of keeping them all! 

I know what's wrong but every once in a while I come back to rationalize the need of another cellphone/smartwatch, whatever. ""I deserve it"", ""I made a bad decision, I should've bought the Ultra version"", ""I can sell this to help me get a newest one"", ""It's ok if I really take advantage of it"". 

It's exhausting and I just cannot stop it. I know it's marketing that had brainwashed me and made me believe I am expressing myself through stuff, I'm enjoying the good things in life, I'm being successful, I need tech (I hate being online each time more). 

I know I like the dopamine rush and I should seek it in non-consumption related stuff. But I keep wasting hours longing for the latest devices.

They're also not necessarily less happy than the people in more well-off provinces. I've seen well-off people suffer because of job exhaustion and lack of life outside of work. Those in poorer provinces might not be able to buy a 70 inch flat screen TV on a whim, but they can make up for it by other, possibly more  reliable indicators of happiness than just consumerism. If there's talk about regional inequality in Malaysia by international organizations, I suspect that it's because Western capitalistic oligarchs want more people to be integrated into an international labor market where no one matters because they're competing with highly skilled Americans and highly cheap Africans, thus enabling the oligarchs to squeeze the most out of them, and that these oligarchs also want these people to be consumers for their products, thereby enabling the oligarchs to enhance their profits and grant their offsprings each a fatter trust fund.

I'm struggling because we have a child now and I have a lot of respect for all religions, yet the time of year has come where I'm conflicted about how I will raise my kid around all this unspiritual gluttony. Friends are already asking about Halloween costumes and trick or treat plans, soon we will be invited to Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings with feasts and presents, Easter will be right around the corner after that ...  I feel like a scrooge but can't deny that it's all unhealthy candy, random items, and gosh I remember being raised around all that and while I have some fond memories I was also a terribly greedy child always wanting more more more. 

Id love to put something more wholesome in place of these holidays, but how to deal with friends, family and society at large as my child grows is constantly on my mind.

Well, replacing the logic board on a 2014 Macbook turns out to not be an easy repair. You basically have to pull out every single component of the machine to access it, which involves untangling lots of fiddly parts packed close together, attached with tiny delicate connectors that are easy to break or bend out of shape.

But... I got it done! Diagnostics all passed with flying colors. Both the speakers are still working, as is the power connector, all of which are things that are apparently very easy to break while doing this repair.

So: reports of my laptop's demise were greatly exaggerated. I've had this thing a decade and counting, and I'm glad to report it's back in working order. All it took was a $147 eBay part, a couple hours of hard work, and an impressive vocabulary of profanities used during the repair.

I am embarrassed to say that I do have *one extra screw* left over after putting it all back together.

I am also concerned this is compulsive overspending, as I don't have experiencing yet managing a salary and looking towards the future.

1. Purchased dress secondhand from Facebook Marketplace. Only paid $250 for a NWOT dress in my size. Such a good deal!
2. Flowers are going to be brought in by a local florist who does floral arrangements as a hobby. I'll be using vintage vases I already own, and guests will take the vases of flowers home at the end of the night. She grows the flowers pesticide free on her own little farm.
3. Buffet style dinner in which the bride and groom get to take any leftover food home at the end of the night.
4. Local venue that sells alcohol by the bottle to reduce waste of kegs, and will allow us to ""sell back"" anything unused.
5. Groom is going to rent a suit, as will groomsmen.
6. Bridesmaids will purchase dresses from Azazie (we're going for a certain look), but I was hoping to help them organize a Facebook Marketplace listing for each dress so they can maybe get a second life. I don't want to do the mismatched bridesmaid dress trend.
7. 3D printed table numbers made by the groom's brother. We're going to try to resell them, the mock-ups look pretty good.
8. Registry is laser-focused onto things we actually need. Including a set of stainless steel cookware. I dislike the new ceramic cookware trend, it'll eventually break down like Teflon coatings.

Thanks everyone :)

But down to the point. I got brta pitcher and 2 water bottles. Pitcher costed 30 dollars and extra filters costed 30( got 4). Water bottles costed 25 dollars. Then I broke one ( definitely my fault). So I got a different one for 20 dollars. Over 100 dollars.

It was medium investment to save the planet. It's same the price with more work. The filters cost 7 dollars for 2 to 3 months of water. That's almost the same amount of money I was spending at Costco to get plastic water bottles for 2 to 3 months. I also wash my water bottle every 1 to 2 days to make sure it doesn't get nasty.

1fsyzem,thebodybuildingvegan,1727711738,Is going Vegan better for reducing consumption? ,"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but I seriously think someone does, and that’s why I wanted to share, regardless.

I know how tough this part of being vegan can be for you.

All the social stigma you always have to deal with.  

The feeling of isolation.  

The difficulty in getting into a relationship.  

Avoiding places you once loved because of your new identity.  

And the ever-dreaded question: “What do you even eat?”

Listen, I honestly get it. 

It's not easy (especially when you're just starting out). 

It took me three years to fully convert, but 18 years down the line, I can confidently tell you that you're on the right track.

I’ll give you two reasons out of many why you truly are.

Firstly, you are helping a greater cause by keeping animals safe from the extreme cruelty they endure in the name of “meat production.”

I know you're familiar with the fate animals face in slaughterhouses. 

Where they are subjected to extreme cruelty, confinement, and brutal deaths. 

Many are crammed into small, dirty spaces, unable to move or exhibit natural behaviors. Workers often handle them roughly, leading to injuries. 

Many are slaughtered without being properly stunned, causing prolonged suffering.

Chickens, pigs, cows, and other farm animals endure brutal conditions before facing violent deaths, all for food production. 

This treatment causes a lot of physical and emotional pain to these animals.

To make matters worse, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, more than 80 billion land animals are slaughtered for meat Every. Single year. Imagine the horror.

That’s why your decision counts. 

With our combined effort, we can help spread the message of goodwill for these poor animals and, one day, hopefully end this cruelty.

The second reason you’re on the right track by being vegan is the nutritional benefits you’re gaining from plant-based meals, which are just a lot to mention.

True, there are many controversies surrounding vegan diets, with claims that they lack basic nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein. 

But is that really the case?

No, it’s not. 

There’s a wide range of vegan products that provide all those necessary nutrients.

You may have also heard the myth that being vegan means you can’t grow muscle (I particularly laugh at this one) because of your diet.

For context, I’ve been a bodybuilder for as long as I can remember, and all my fitness gains and successes have been achieved since I became vegan. 

To further prove that this works for others too, I’ve helped many people achieve the same results using plant-based recipes.

Do you now understand why you can never go wrong with being vegan?

It's an honorable cause you’ve undertaken, and the Earth is proud of you.

P.S. You’re never alone on this journey, we've all got each other’s backs. 

I hope this helps inspire someone.

(alt title:When do you throw away socks?),"Apologies if this isn’t quite the right place to ask this question but I figured since throwing away socks means I will inevitably have to buy more socks the concept of anticonsumption applies a bit. I don’t want to buy new socks if I don’t necessarily need them but I’m going through the socks I own and oof some definitely need to be discarded, I just grew up poor so my concept of when a sock is too destroyed is skewed. So I still save socks that have holes that I consider “minor” but maybe I shouldn’t be saving as much as I do.

Do any of you have certain standards for when a sock is too far gone to keep wearing? Do you get rid of socks as soon as holes appear or only once the holes become too big to wear comfortably (ex: a hole big enough for a toe to stick through)? I know people will have different standards but hearing multiple perspectives will be helpful for me in making decisions.

1freka4,Liziania,1727530890,Any recent examples of brand activism? And do you think it's helpful or bogus?,"I'm from Ukraine, and the amount of war references in products, services, and brand communication there is insane. On the one hand, some businesses are being extremely supportive, donating a lot of money, organising fundraisers, and stuff, so if I absolutely have to buy a t-shirt, I'd love to buy something that's also going to be somewhat helpful. On the other hand, sometimes you see products where people lazily slam some war-related meme on a t-shirt just to ride the hype tide. Not only does it drive unnecessary consumption, it cheapens everything that happens on the frontlines rn. But then again, maybe sometimes people need a silly little reminder in their surroundings to lift the mood, so the person producing them is just responding to the wants of the public? 

  
One of the examples is Bucha-Kombucha. A town that suffered from war atrocities became a branding element of fizzy hip drink.

Here's a project initiated by two big Ukrainian grocery retailers: [https://u24.gov.ua/artemsil](https://u24.gov.ua/artemsil) The salt from now occupied mines in Soledar is sold as a souvenir, and all profit is donated to the Flotilla of Kamikaze Drones for the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine. Somehow it feels more ethical. Or is it because of nice branding and art direction.

  
Of course, it's not the issue of paramount importance amidst the war with ruzzia, but I think it might be worth looking into this, as it illustrates well how brands blend with culture nowadays.

1fqv5vv,LDlOyZiq,1727463233,"Look at this! It's got ""AI"" written on it!"," 
It feels like you're stranded on an island, struggling for food, water and shelter, meanwhile Monkey Business Inc. (which is somehow also on the island) ramps up investment and production of drain cleaner, and advertises it right into your face, like you have a purpose for it.

It seems more like a liability than an asset to have, and spend time on. Whenever a consumer grade AI product get's advertised to me, especially by big tech, generally it only makes me repulsive to even just look into it. 

When it gets built into tech products, it arguably makes the product worse, and only acts as a distraction. I don't wanna buy a product, if its main selling point is largely advertised with the two letter word that is ""AI.""

And I have used GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion (among others), but they've never added that much value to my life or workflow.

I also feel like there is a huge disparity between the actual consumer demand, and investment as well as advertising. Similarly to the Chinese housing bubble burst, where prices and construction were through the roof, because it was expected that demand would be high, but it turned out it wasn't. Similarly to NFTs, I wouldn't be surprised if this also happened to AI companies.

While I still doubt the capabilities of AI in conjungtion with the average human, I am also afraid that in the future, we'll just end up with arteficial intelligence but real stupidity.

In a comercial setting, such as for cancer detection (which is amazing btw.), this makes total sense to me. Yet the presence of AI in the consumer market, just doesn't add up to me, for the reasons above. At least not the extend where AI gets shoved up the arse of every product in existance and ads for it get plastered in my face at every opportunity.

However, I am probably just being overly cautious and critical.

Does anyone else have similar feelings, or can comment on the matter?

Edit:
- My comparison to NFTs is flawed, but just felt right. I was mostly about bubbles bursting
- After some chatting I realised that I mostly had pent up frustration with how poorly it's advertised to me.
- I don't have anything against the idea of AI, the marketing and state of the market makes it frustrating to look at and really explore

he is sometimes open to my suggestions for anti-consumption, but just a week ago we fought again about his choice to buy a plastic spray home fragrance when i suggested an incense sticks or an essential oil burner. i'm scared he's going to resent me for trying to change his lifestyle, since in today's discussion he brought up past examples of my interference.

i'm trying to build an ideal life with anti-consumption, anti-capitalism and environmental values in mind, and i am judgemental even to my own habits, and probably will always be, since it's really difficult to escape this hell completely. but i'm seriously in doubt if this is getting out of control, a little bit obsessive.

My grocery bills are so buckwild, that I doubt we will be having any type of bid Christmas. I have fond memories from my childhood of getting a sweater, a bracelet, some socks and a book for Christmas as a preteen, and being THRILLED. I REALLY want my kids to feel the same joy at the useful and practical, not the large-volume, expensive and cheaply-made. What are some things you ARE NOT buying this year? These are mine:

1. A chore/barn jacket (they are ""in"" right now). I have a literal Carhartt that was battered and used by my father. You can't get any more ""chore jacket"" than that.

2. Cheap toys. Although my kids do often find them fun in the moment, they end up as plastic waste. And it's not just the toys themselves. Often the packaging for these toys is SO WASTEFUL.

3. Christmas tchotchkes. There are always so many santa pez dispensers, christmas shirts, holiday earrings/headbands, etc. The second you get them, the holiday is already over. I have one Christmas sweater I've used for 6 years, and that's all I need.

4. Fast fashion. My preteen LOVES a lot of the fast fashion stores, but I find that everything I buy for them from Old Navy, Target, Wal-Mart, etc. end up breaking down after several washes. My kids wear their clothes to death, so I don't find these stores worth it. I use Christmas to get them high quality basics.

5. Overpriced/expensive food for guests/potlucks. I'm a bit older, so I was raised on the idea that you bring your best, most expensive, most tedious food to every gathering and for every time you host. It was seen as a way to show love and generosity to family and friends, and it was so fun and delicious when everyone did that. The last several years, I've noticed that people either don't bring anything at all, or they will bring a discount bag of chips.

* * * * *


Warning: long whine :(

I moved to Seattle last summer, and my mental health has been so rough. I didn’t realize summer seasonal affective disorder was a thing - and we get 16 hours of sunlight!!

I have the urge to upgrade all sorts of old stuff.

- My 10+ year old keyboard, which works fine except a couple of keys have minor contact issues? I want a new shiny one.

- I dropped my 15-year-old monitor when trying to put a VESA mount on it - it worked great but I wasn’t able to coordinate achedules with a guy at work who offered to glue it together, so I just bought a new one (open-box, at least; I work hard to buy refurbished or clearance tech products to reduce e-waste).

- I use the webcam on my laptop, which is now to the right of my 2 monitors - and rather than just move my monitors around (they’re mounted on arms) to put my laptop in the middle, I started browsing standalone webcams.

- Rather than do the week-old pile of dishes in my sink, when I was down with bad period cramps yesterday, I ordered groceries via Instacart and added a pack of compostable flatware to my order.

- I sold my full-sized sofa before moving cross-country so I just have an Ikea Klippan loveseat - which is fine for sitting, but provides no head/neck support. So I want a new full-sized sofa or recliner, but feel bad spending the money. And I have too much clutter to make room for it.

I have depression and ADHD. My job is so intense, and my Ritalin wears out right as the workday ends so I come home and crash. (Or wander over to my sofa and crash on WFH days.) I don’t have a social life. I started at a gym a month ago, but then went on vacation and caught covid and haven’t had the strength/motivation to go back ever since. And I’m too depressed to go through the effort of finding a therapist - the ultimate catch-22, right?

Just. PLEASE HELP ME SNAP OUT OF THIS. I want to get rid of so much stuff - not bring it in! I have piles of disorganized clutter that I want to just put away and inventory so I stop buying duplicates at Target (like toiletries and household goods).

1fmpmgf,lifeline-main99,1726998727,I feel like we are entering a grift economy,"The magnum opus of those who defend capitalism is “capitalism breeds innovation” well I think it doesn’t and I, for one am sick of hearing it

Quick disclaimer before I start: I’ve been lurking here a little and I’m not familiar with the culture but I can only assume you guys are very objective and this will be a subjective rant so forgive if I say something out-of-line.

I’ve heard so many times that capitalism makes the world better by forcing corporations to compete for better products when that is so not true

Right now the best way to make a profit isn’t to improve your product to boost sales but it’s to skimp out on us and sell us bullshit.

Corporations will bend the words of the law to their favor to sell us slop, like seriously have you SEEN r/shrinkflation lately? They’re trying to quietly sell us less for more without ever improving anything.

I can’t name anything new or innovative about the iPhone since it first began they’ve just gotten bigger, more expensive, and better at stealing your data. Just point a camera at your phone and you’ll see that it is recording a video of you right now.

And i haven’t even gotten to the meat of the problem yet! This is just the surface. Back when nfts were popular everybody would pressure you into buying them knowing that it would probably be a pump and dumb scheme or something. And it actually worked! A bunch of idiots bought these legal scams and suffered the consequences.

Seriously I could tell you 2 separate times where my phone was tracking me. The first was when I was using vr and I accidentally saw my phone through the cams on the front to reveal it was watching me and not only that the second time I mentioned how I was always itchy to my friends and the next ad on Reddit I saw was for anti-itch shampoo.

This kind of scamming and grifting isn’t anything new either. Wonder why there are tags on mattresses saying what their made of and why it was illegal to remove? That was because the manufactures would dump unsanitary shit into the mattresses so they didn’t have to fill it with cotton. And have you all forgotten that nestle sent fake nurses to sell baby formula to the uneducated masses in rural and underdeveloped countries which increased the infant death rate (im not saying mortality rate because that’s corporate jargon to make death not seem so bad) because all the water they had was dirty? They couldn’t even do anything about it when they found out because they were too reliant on the formula already and the women couldn’t breast feed their children.

Imagine being a mother in already squalid conditions who is forced to knowingly poison your baby with non-nutritious and dirty baby formula because the nurses (that you thought were real) sold you this “miracle” formula and now you can’t make breast milk because of it!

This economy isn’t making people better off it’s making people reliant and addicted to what they sell us so that they can spy on you and scam you out of the money that you earned by actually providing value to society!

Rant over. Please pretend that I was screaming while you were reading this and always remember:

1fn47ru,Yellowcake454,1727040636,Tourism and consumerism ,"Every now and then I would read anti-consumption advocates saying that through deliberate purchases you can save money and spend it on experiences, travelling, etc. Tourism goes hand in hand with consumerism, don't kid yourself.

I live in a mid-size Balkan city (with metropolitan area c. 500K) and starting with 2010s, more and more tourist started pouring in mainly from the West and rich Arab countries. At the beginning, it was really a positive thing economically speaking. Hotels, hostels, airbnbs starting popping up, local restaurant and shop had more customers, there were more menial jobs for the locals, foreigners were interesting at least and we have a social norm that we have to be good hosts. I lived in an another country for several years and once I came back I was surprised how the fabric of the city change to accommodate the tourists and their ""cravings"".

The food in fast foods and restaurants was always affordable for the locals. Now the prices skyrocketed and in some spots they have tripled or quadrupled (there is also an inflation). Gentrification is on the rampage the past two years. Prices in the shops, drinks, every day stuff increased significantly. The old artisanal quarters are now flooded with cheap Turkish imitations since tourists can't tell them apart. The old part of town is always crowded, everything there is catered for tourists, people are moving out from the old town and central part of the city to airbnb their flats, rents are going up, hotel chains are buying spots in the historical part of the city and raising ten floor buildings, business started opening up to sell non-authentic local experiences. I only go there when I have friends visiting, it's unbearable. The number of tourists coming each year is growing exponentially, and most of the profits are going to a relatively small group of investors that are seeing this as an easy money opportunity. And don't get me started what is this doing to the mountains, forests, nature in general. As in most Balkan countries the laws and regulations bend over to capital. A lot of properties in the outskirts are being bought and turn into seasonal villas, so the price of land is now four or five times higher than it was a decade ago. Plus, they started to build gated communities with these villas! Since the walls are up, I sort of want to rob them just so they can get what they manifested... I'm joking.

My city is too small to absorb this number of tourists. The landscape, urbanism, culture, economy is evolving codependently with tourism, and not in a good way. Also this is Balkans, there will never ever never be a farsighted policy changes that could tackle these issues. I know other European cities have the same and if not worse issues, but I didn't found yet a sustainable idea that would balance tourism and prevent the city turning into a soulless money pouring drainage of consumed experiences. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against people visiting, but I found that I'm hiding my favorite places from foreigners (except friends) so they don't stop by for an ""authentic"" experience and ruin the place for me. I also became very aware and self-conscious of my own impact in other places that I'm visiting. I'm avoiding places where I know tourism has negatively reflected in significant ways the quality of lives of locals.

What are you thoughts about this? It would be great if both tourists and the locals whose cities turned into tourist places chip in their opinions. Also, what do you think the right approach regarding tourisms should be an from anti-consumerist perspective?

1fmtc9r,No-Cheesecake-5721,1727011895,I’m addicted to consumerism… help!,"I wasn’t always like this… but in the past couple of years I have grown addicted to shopping, collecting, and buying more than I need. I think it started when I got a better job and had the means to buy more.

I am not a hoarder, but I do come from a family of hoarders. I grew up in poverty so we were always buying secondhand or things on sale.. but we still bought frequently. I think a part of my mindset comes from my fear of being poor again and not having enough of what I need. 

I do avoid being a hoarder and having too much stuff by selling or gifting what I don’t “need” anymore, but then I replace it with something else. Trust me, I know it’s wrong. 

To be fair, I used to only shop second hand and felt that justified the consuming, but I’ve noticed a growing trend in my life where I frequent places I used to avoid for ethical moral reasons. Instead of second hand I might buy from Target or Amazon or something of the like. I genuinely hate this behavior. I hate that I might buy something just because a “sale” is going on. I’m struggling because I have strong moral convictions about my shopping, but it’s difficult to stop the habit. I’ve followed this reddit for a while and it causes me a lot of guilt even though I firmly believe in anti consumption. 


This is a cycle I have wanted to break but don’t know how. I used to be a very careful shopper, but I’m not sure how to get back to that behavior.

Net Zero 2050 is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net zero CO₂ emissions around 2050. Some jurisdictions such as the US, EU and Japan reach net zero for all greenhouse gases by this point.

# Low Demand

The Low Demand scenario assumes that significant behavioral changes, reducing energy demand, mitigate the pressure on the economic system to reach global net zero CO2 emissions around 2050.

# Below 2 °C

Below 2 °C gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving a 67 % chance of limiting global warming to below 2 °C.

# Delayed Transition

Delayed Transition assumes global annual emissions do not decrease until 2030. Strong policies are then needed to limit warming to below 2 °C. Negative emissions are limited.

# Nationally Determined Contributions

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) includes all pledged policies even if not yet implemented.

# Current Policies

Current Policies assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks.

1fmanrl,MarketingWhisperer,1726946422,We Spend More Energy Flexing For Strangers Than Building Meaningful Lives,"Apple is a genius at marketing. I saw a video on the [](/user/OnlyInDade/) Instagram account showing a line of people camping out overnight for the new iPhone 16.

And how many are buying the new iPhone just to flex and say they got it, rather than because they need it for work?

It got me thinking: people will camp out overnight for the latest iPhone just to show off a device that’ll be outdated in a year (at this time next year the iPhone 17 will be out). But why don’t we put that same energy into things that actually matter beyond the dopamine hit? Relationships, personal growth, experiences. Why not put that energy into getting right with God or spending time with our kids, instead of letting MrBeast and YouTube influencers raise them?

It’s crazy how trends and flex culture have outranked what really matters in life. We’re prioritizing shiny objects over things that actually bring value.

Apparently robot vacuums aren't ""cool"" anymore, so I've been seeing a metric ton of them dropped at the thrift store. I can't imagine anyone buys them, since they seem to pile up. Back in the day, robot vacuums were a rich man golf club 5 Mercedes with gold trim product people dreamed of owning but never actually had a chance at.

But I can't seem to fully unlearn consumerism, and thus I still always end up feeling bad. ","Been into anti consumerism and zero waste for a while now, but, always struggled with actually staying away from consumerism. But I'm getting closer and closer to my final straw. 

A lot of products are made by literal slavery, think outsourcing to 3rd world countries or prison labor. And even in ""proper"" and ""civilized"" western countries, it's mostly overworked, underpaid minimum wage workers. On top of that, I'm not far off when I say that quite literally every single brand/corporation supports war criminals, racists, or homophobes. That is if they aren't either of these things themselves, which they also almost all are. 

The fact that (almost) everything you buy or eat comes from war criminals and other human rights violators.... why should you fall into the hellhole of consumerism anymore? I get that certain things are necessary, but, other than that, why would you?

Don't get me wrong, I'm still unlearning years of this bullshit myself, but, it's starting to become more and more clear to me. Right now I'm in the phase where I just feel really bad and hollow knowing everything I buy and ever bought comes from actual human scum. Not sure I'll ever get over that feeling. Wish I could warn others about it, but either people don't want to know, don't care, or the powers that be actively suppress that kind of information from floating around. 

It just feels so bad and wrong, and yet I haven't entirely unlearned consumerism... does anyone here feel like they've accomplished that? How so? Any tips or advice?

Eventhough I’m an engineer at the same time, I’ve never been very interested in technology and I find it kinda frightening that AI has gotten so powerful. I find many areas of use of AI unnecessary, and things like deepfake and AI art irritate me.

Like I said, I’m doing master’s in applied maths and I’m interested in uses of maths in medicine and healthcare, and those areas mostly contain AI. AI is actually a powerful tool in healthcare because it can be used to analyze medical data and help diagnose diseases more accurately and in earlier stages. However, it may sound naive but I feel like if I move forward in this field, I will be a part of something I don't support. Of course I don’t claim that AI is bad in every field, but I feel like as with all things that are products of capitalism, its long-term harms to humanity and nature may outweigh its benefits.

1fl42le,NyriasNeo,1726807401,A way to satisfy the shopping dopamine rush without buying a single object,"The answer, of course, is doing it in an open world game. To be fair, not all games can do this, but some do. I will use one of my favorite game, fallout 76 to illustrate. In this game, you can own a house (or actually houses). You can buy collectables, outfits, furniture, beehives, and even robot pets.

By now, you may be thinking I am talking about micro-transaction that involves paying real money for virtual objects. No no no .. I am talking about playing the game, earn in-game currency and then shop. If you play the game, you can earn gold in the game. And you can use this gold to buy stuff from other players. Players often set up shops for the extra stuff they have. To be fair, they do have a real money shop, but you 100% do not need to use real money.

And the dopamine rush is real, although what you buy is not. Nothing is produced. Nothing is wasted except may be a little electricity that runs your game. It is order of magnitude lower than the resource needed to ship you one real plastic trinket. 

And this game downright encourage collections. I have a collection of masks, displayed in glass cabinets. A collection of beer steins. A collection of cards. A collection of apparel, with mannequin to display them (and you can wear them on your character). It is a rush to find a collectable I do not have in a player operated shop and buy it.

The only downside is that you have to like the game enough to play it to earn gold. But if you do, you can have a non-wasteful, anti-consumption, shopping spree. Sometimes I will just log in to browse player stores (they also have some NPC vendors too).

Pig farms are often mentioned. Some articles online claim it gets donated. 

Pig farms are not ideal, even if they had the millions of pigs required to chow down all the scraps, because humans shouldnt be consuming pork that is on an insane non standard diet. Animals did not develop to have the same stomach as humans, and their natural feed is not full of random combinations of macros such as saturated fats. It also seems weird to be eating Nevadan pork, that ate all that human food. Its almost cannibalistic, in a weird uroboro kind of way.

Donations are also peculiar, since I heard that the hotels stopped doing that after being sued. I cant believe that the laws would not simply adjust to allow “a good samaritan” kind of law where donated food cannot be the item of a lawsuit. Furthermore, its even more weird to think somebody becomes homeless here, perhaps due to gambling, and then gets served more hotel food from where he presumably lost all the money.

Tourism accounts for 8% of global emissions, and commuting by car and bus contributes about 9%.

* [https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport)

For some people changing their commute may not be an option, but it should be something to consider if taking a new job. And if you need to travel for groceries or other necessities, try to limit the number of trips.

Changing the mode of travel doesn't really make a huge difference unless you're getting efficiencies similar to bicycling. Electric cars are not good enough, and neither are most trains. You might be able to save 50% of the greenhouse gases, but you are not getting down to orders of magnitude in savings. This is mostly due to the upfront infrastructure cost or manufacturing cost. Highly utilized light rail, and electric buses may be the exception, especially for those that are mobility limited.

* [https://tnmt.com/infographics/carbon-emissions-by-transport-type/](https://tnmt.com/infographics/carbon-emissions-by-transport-type/)

The only thing you can do is cut down your traveling and commuting by an order of magnitude if you want to see real results when it comes to green house gases. Every kilometer or mile you travel is adding to the carbon footprint of humanity in roughly the same amount. (except where noted above)

The reason I bring up traveling as opposed to a vegetarian/vegan diet, buying less stuff, having less children, etc, is because traveling is one of hardest pills to swallow for most people who have the means.

And to be clear, I'm specifically talking about when you have a choice. If you have the choice to travel from NYC to New Zealand for vacation, instead consider visiting Quebec City.

1fk2qw5,poddy_fries,1726691248,Thoughts on maternity clothes,"I just gave birth to my second child, and I've been thinking about everything that's been different with that process since I had my first 7 years ago. One of the standout points was maternity clothes. 

For one thing, every single maternity store in my area shut down in the last 7 years. I still had some pieces I'd bought new that weren't clearly 'maternity' and that I have been wearing since then, I managed to buy some good used pants and a couple of tops off of Marketplace, but that's it for quality. I presume with people having fewer kids generally, there's less of an audience for well-made clothes that can last several pregnancies - a side effect I hadn't thought about. You can get away with 'normal' or 'slightly larger' clothes to an extent, but pregnancy doesn't make you bigger everywhere. Some things need specific fits. 

I ended up buying some pregnancy panties and tights off Amazon - and I can't say that the tights survived ONE pregnancy. All three did well enough at first but are showing obvious wear after what amounts to 6 months of occasional use, which annoys me to no end. I find it extreme even for a world of fast fashion. By the time my swelling goes down and I have no use for them, they will be no good to resell or give away at all. Meanwhile the used clothes from the good maternity brands will be going on to their next home with no problem. It's an impressive difference.

1fjolhf,NitroManKulfiKat,1726651342,Does anyone think social media is a big problem?,"Hi,

I recently read an article on Substack about the effects of social media. It got me thinking about how I spend my day... It seems almost 50% of my day is spent on the Internet, either browsing through Instagram, X, or Reddit. Tbh, Reddit is much better. The other part of my time on the internet is spent browsing content on Netflix or YouTube. Overall I think it's starting to take over my life.

I'm starting to think it's becoming something like an addiction. I don't even know how to stop! It's been something that's bothering me. Thankfully I found this subreddit.

So, do any of you think it's a big problem? Or maybe I'm overthinking it? Any tips or suggestions on how to limit my consumption?

Both fashion and corporate greed have completely messed up what jeans were/stood for, they were pants that'd last you forever, and once the pant legs got too messed up from wear you'd cut off everything below the knee and turn them into shorts.
I swear to god any pair of jeans with even a single % of any kind of stretchy material will break when you put them on a bit rough, and I can't for the life of me figure out why people are fine spending the same amount of money for a pair of pants that lasts about a 5th of the time, I just don't get it.

Side tangent: sneakers are also a horrid mess, bought about 5 pairs throughout my life, first few I outgrew as I got them as a kid whereas the others all had the sole rip off the shoe itself. Followed in my dad's shoes (pun intended) and went with army boots made of leather, none of that newer ""breathable fabric"" either. Last pair lasted me 10+ years while not taking care of them at all, did they look new? No, they were scuffed to all hell, but they still fit, were watertight and didn't hurt me feet nor back even on long walks. For ~€100 a pair, I dare anyone to find shoes for €10/year that don't fall apart.

Side side tangent: I got a lot more stuff that just popped into my head about people just accepting any device as ""broken"" when it's something as minor as a leaked battery, and many more things along those lines. But I'll keep those for other posts. I'm 26 but feel like this part of me is 75 or smth.

1fiijmg,MatthewJet28,1726526960,Just hit me: iPhone has made me addicted to the digital world and my brain is fragmented ,"I’ve genuinely realized firsthand that I’m addicted to social media and fast content consumption. I find myself jumping from using ChatGPT to watching a cat reel, then replying to a text from a friend, then back to social media, only to get an email that pulls me into Gmail. Then I forget I was on social media and return to ChatGPT. 

My brain is constantly bombarded with stimuli, leaving me anxious and disconnected from the present. 

Part of the problem is the iPhone itself—it’s so well-designed, with an amazing screen, vibrant colors, and powerful performance in every aspect. I remember when I had a low-end Android, this didn’t happen. So, considering that I’m currently using my iPhone Pro Max for everything, I’m thinking of removing the SIM card and putting it into a low-end Android. This would become my minimalist phone, with no social media, just maybe WhatsApp and email. I’d use the iPhone for specific tasks, limiting it to evenings with a maximum of 30 minutes to 1 hour of use.

Additionally, on Android, there are third-party apps that can help create a healthier social media experience by blocking the reel section, stories, ads, etc.

1fio34l,hlg64,1726541878,The budol phenomenon and Filipino consumption,"In the Philippines, we have a word that we use for methods that criminals use to scam you.

*budol*

It's when a con artists persuades you, almost like hypnosis, to give them your money. Only after the crimes happens do the victims realize what they had done. It's a scary scam because they put the victim in such vulnerability and leaves them very disoriented.

It has since evolved its meaning to accomodate our consumerist society. Nowadays, it's being used to describe for when you didn't want to buy a product but got convinced to do so.

Small-time sellers used this word, whether ironically or unironically, to convince customers to buy their wares. Sellers feel accomplished when they get successful and buyers feel proud to be convinced. It didn't take long before brands rode the wave of using a term for a crime method to make their marketing palatable and relatable to the hoi polloi.

Unfortunately, the Filipino masses buy into [lol] the new meaning. I was in a filipino subreddit and one person asked, ""Did you get budol-ed this 9.9 sale?"" Asian e-commerce platforms hold sales on double-digit days. I pointed out that I didn't get budol-ed because i'm not gullibe enough to be scammed and i think about a product before i buy it. For a subreddit who have a lot of people pride themselves as ""underconsumption gurlies"", it's ironic to see them get riled up at the essence of the trend they're following.

Philippines is a poor country. With the popularization of cashless transactions, Filipinos feel more ""empowered"" because they can now buy online instead of traveling to the cities to buy in malls and stores. When sale season comes, brands in e-commerce platforms coopt the ""budol"" term to whitewash it. And what's worse is consumers use it on themselves. ""Nabudol ako"" (i got scammed) is a common phrase now. It's disgusting seeing everyone normalize being scammed by brands and sellers and boast of it. They wear the ""budol"" pin so proudly.

1fhvtu2,kaichai444,1726459621,Do we overconsume because the reward of building something from scratch is absent?,"I think yes. In modern society, we are often distanced from the processes of creation—whether it's the food we eat, the products we use, or the media we consume. This distancing erodes the sense of accomplishment that comes from seeing tangible results of our efforts. Instead of the deep satisfaction gained through the slower, more intentional process of making something ourselves, we often seek quick rewards, which consumer culture readily provides. Most of us are consumed by 40 hour workweeks, and the easily accessible goods require zero labor involved to consume. The time and effort required to build something from scratch—whether it's a meal, a craft, or even an intellectual project—stand in stark contrast to the ease of simply purchasing or consuming pre-made items. This convenience can blunt our capacity to derive pleasure from the act of creation, which requires patience, focus, and delayed rewards. The absence of this deeper satisfaction might compel people to seek fulfillment through material acquisition, leading to a reliance on external sources for gratification rather than on one's creative abilities. Thanks to the Industrial Revolution and other capitalistic endeavors, you now have talented and able-bodied people led to believe they do not have the time or ability to build a new bookshelf, or knit a nice skirt, or collect materials for crafting when that’s the furthest from the truth. 
So why is it that when you DO create something, you are very hesitant to replace it? It’s simple, you’ve dedicated your labor into something you deem meaningful. The use-value of what you made is through the roof in comparison to that cute thing from Tj-Maxx. It’s no longer just an object, it’s a physical embodiment of the time and effort you placed into it. If you work 40 hours a week with 8 hours of sleep, you still have 70+ hours to dedicate to repairing what you have and creating something new (sometimes without any cost!). 70 hours a week to find a pattern for that shirt you were eyeing, 30 dollars for a sewing machine from Facebook marketplace. 2 hours at most to watch a YouTube tutorial. It’s way too easy to just go to the store and shop around, because you’re led to believe there’s no time otherwise, or you’re not crafty enough, but that’s so far from the truth for most. Even bit by bit, you can work towards making what you need even if it does take a ton of tutorials.


I grew up poor and got a big girl job in college fairly young, a perfect recipe for a shopping addiction. After not even two days, whatever I bought no longer had any meaning to me, or use for that matter. That cute top collected dust in my closet, and I never even glanced at the paintings I picked up. I started dedicating the most of my free time to taking inventory of what I needed and wanted, and whatever I so much thought as having the ability to make, I did. Anything else, Facebook marketplace. I go to school full time and work part-time, but the skirts I see on Pinterest take me 30 minutes to sew. I fought the urge to immediately fill the spaces on my wall and took a year to fill it up with my own works and the works of my friends. It’s way too easy to buy, but it’s way more rewarding to make.

Then I paused … well how did I clean the house before without an apron? I just cleaned. I have to wash my clothes anyway! Plus I have overalls for gardening, I can use those for cleaning.

Also I can try making an apron with clothes I don’t use anymore.

Feeling proud of myself because previous me would have let my brain win and purchased the apron.

After almost a month of daily (ab)use, my glued headphones broke ... ON THE OTHER SIDE!!!

The repaired side is still holding strong and yesterday evening I got the chance to even out the look a little bit. Same technique used, only not as many layers of superglue+soda because I ran out.

This is seriously my fave repair technique and I've used it to fix so many things besides these headphones - a fridge drawer, a glass lamp, a laptop casing, and a mug handle. All holding up perfectly. I've used more superglue in the last week than in my 30+ years of life, and there's still more things I want to fix. Repair ftw.

I didn't stop there with the headphones, though. I scratched off all the peeling material from the earpads, and wrapped the headband part with some yarn that matches my desk setup et voilá! A cute, sturdy pair of headphones.

Ignore the mess, we've been really busy. 😬😆

As far as I know, the cabinets are either original or 1960's (there was a note on the listing that some renovation was done in '67). They do need some new hinges, as some of the doors don't close fully, but otherwise in great shape.

The stove is from 1999 lol & still works great (though the oven takes a bit long to get to temp). Portable dishwasher is 2005 (we do plan on installing a regular dishwasher eventually, but it's not a priority & I have to figure out a good plan that keeps the cabinets in tact as much as possible without losing too much space). Not sure the age of the fridge, as I haven't looked up the serial number. 

Previous homeowners put peel off wallpaper over the tile backsplash behind the sink, which I plan on uncovering and keeping (I just don't want to yet bc this house is already so white & I want to paint the kitchen walls first lol). 

I don't love the gray LVP (and the previous owners didn't do the best job installing it tbh), but I'll probably be able to live with it more when I get some color on the walls.

Like, I never see people focus on Reusing when it comes to the 3 Rs. Me, I grew up with “hillbilly Tupperware.” Think the cookie tin sewing kits or the Crocker tubs with leftovers. Instead of buying Tupperware, I use the plastic my food comes in to store leftovers, and glass jars that I can’t take back to the store store grease. 

At best, I see this stuff ignored. Usually it’s regarded as trashy. It’s never use the plastic your food came in, it’s buy more plastic so you don’t use disposable plastic. It’s buy multiple Stanley cups for the environment rather than reuse that one water bottle you bought when you left old trusty at home.

Now that I’m comfortable (not well-off, but able to afford extras here and there), I realized consumerism has taken over my time and mental health.

I could finally afford it, no more somedays, or if onlys. I could buy these things now and still pay my bills!  All bought secondhand or from a cruelty free company, so what’s the harm? I was a mindful, conscientious consumer. But the harm is there, it comes from the inside. It’s the hours spent finding things online to “improve” myself or my life. It’s the high of finding a good deal on fb marketplace and driving over to pick it up, rain or shine. It’s looking for things to buy to delay the pain from the loss of my dad, then my mom, then ignoring the toxic relationship I can’t seem to walk away from, the idea that having this or that will make my circumstances better, my life more fulfilling, will help me forget the pain of everyday life, things we all go through and have to work through as a part of the human experience.

The problem for the company is that some software doesn't run on old devices or that they have to switch to a new operating system for compliancy reasons.

Many firms, sadly, just give them to recycling - when they're perfectly functional laptops, only thing being they're 5-8 years old.

My company sells old ones. I could secure one for 20 bucks (really, that money is just some change to them, they're glad if they're gone) and inspected it.

So go check for inventory resells / company liquidations, look at your local hardware store or repair shop if they have old models or secure one secondhand.

This is my little rant about realizing I've been trying to buy my happines this whole time because I hated my life. At least I did it second hand but damn thinking I could've been doing this for many more years to come is terryfing. 


I'm very young just finished school. I was constantly miserable with school and trying to graduate and whenever I wasn't busy with school I would go thrifting with my mom and by all kinds of dresses shoes whatever to fill the whole. I have my whole room filled with shit I don't want. I move to a different country with my mom when I was younger and I have been only more and more deppressed since, on my phone all day in bed eating candy. When I travelled to my home country for vacation I felt born again I was so happy, cured, I cut my sugar by half or even more. I wasn't on my phone as much and I was truly happy from the inside. I took smaller doses of my anti deppressant( by consolting a doctor) and I was hsppy every day. Coming back home hit me like a bus, I am more depressed again and looking at all the belongings in my room I am angry. I don't need it, it was my coping mechanism all those years, I want to leave and never come back.


Even if I work minimum wage job in my home country I will be happier than if I stay here rich. This country has been killing me for years stealing my soul I was on the verge of trying to take my own life so many times because of how much I hated it. I didn't have a reason to live other than hoping for a better future and my loved ones.


This country has traumatized me and destroyed my mental health. I could never open up to anyone about it noone understood me or felt like me this ugly hot disgusting country was my invisible prison. And on top of that my step-fathers family was making it worse they are mentaly ill and hated me for no reason.


Now I realized I can be happy again I want to give away all the things I don't need and live a simple happy life in my motherland. My mom got married here and we were hoping to have a better life here, not realizing how good I had it. I hate this country I hate the people living here I hate the culture. I hate every single thing about this place. But even more so I am angry I lost years of my life here pitting myself laying in bed.


Thank you for reading my story I hope to leave and live a good life without all these clothes, books, toys, plushies and shit. I will leave as soon as I can.

He won't admit it, but he does, he's told me, and showed me the proof, that he has 10K USD worth of funko pops. He has them all in his room, in the boxes. 

He has them on multiple shelves, and so many that there is a literal row behind the main ones up front, an entire row of ones that you can't even see unless you look over the front row to inspect. And that's for every shelf in his room, and there's six in total.

Everytime we go out, he often ends up buying at least a couple of funko pops, and it's gotten rather irritating. He complains about being broke sometimes and wishes he had a job, but everytime he makes a little bit of money doing chores for his parents, he buys funko pops. It's like he screws himself over constantly, he wants more money and to move out and be independent, but keeps spending money on these stupid wastes of plastic.

Don't even get me started on how much of an insult these pieces of garbage are to figure collecting, they are mass produced cheap pieces of trash that poorly represent the characters they get licensing for, all to maintain the same soulless pose, soulless eyes, and blank slate expression. My friend insists on buying these stupid things, especially so if the pop is the only ""figure"" they have for that franchise. For example if say a popular video game only had a couple funko pops as figure merch, and no other figures, he insists he has to buy it if it's a game he likes.

I need to convince him to stop buying these things, but everytime I bring it up he won't seem to budge? What do I do? Do I just take the L and just stop saying something about it? Even my other friends agree that he has a problem with these things, and I'm all for spending on hobbies and fandoms, but funko pops are the literal embodiment of just mindless consumption, anytime I see people with funko pops, they always seem to have just these massive collections of them, often still in the box for ""resale value""

I apologize for the long rant, I'm just not even sure what to do anymore. I guess what bothers me is that he complains about money but keeps spending on these things, and seeing a bro fumble just pains me in general.

1fd3zhh,LevoSong,1725925119,Getting rid of one of the most aggravating thing of consumer society : the ads.,"Ads … we have to deal with ad nowadays for whatever we do. With the emergence of the web and smartphones, ads are now finding their ways all the way to our homes and pockets...

However, I learned of a way to block some of them on your local network, meaning all the devices you use inside of your home. The way is to use a server running a general blocking DNS such as PiHole or Adguard Home and use it as your local DNS.

*For those who don't know, a DNS is roughly what allows people to access a web site or a service by translating an web address (readable by humans, such as 'www.reddit.com') to an IP address (which is the address, understandable by a machine, of a server where the content one wants to access is stored).*

When you run such a server, all the addresses known as ad provider are filtered and blocked out. Some of the tracking website are filtered out too which is good. Moreover, with the one I use, you can block access to any services you don't want used in your network (Blizzard, Google, Steam and many more) AND you can block adult web sites too (parental control if you will)…

So yeah, I figure it does a lot.

----------------

The drawbacks however is you need to have a computer that runs permanently. You also need to set-up either your router or each of your devices individually, to go through the said DNS. If you are really not at ease with technology it's not that easy (but if you like ""challenges"" there is a lot of documentation, tutorials and videos on the web that can help you).

Of course an easier way would be to use any web browser ad blockers. There are limits however as the one you use is not guaranteed to be maintained on the long run, and you are subject to the goodwill of the company that develops your browser to allow the use of the ad block extension you use. Also, some of the ad blocker extension are not to be installed on some of default smartphones web browsers.

----------------

So how did I do it (i'm not an expert and maybe some people here know better. If it's the case i'm all open to suggestions).

- I bought a second-hand mini fanless computer for about 30€ and some used ram for 10€. So it was cheap, and electricity consumption is low if not negligible due to the computer not being powerful and not having a fan (also, it makes no noise.)  
- I installed an operative system allowing to install virtual machine. On one of the virtual machine I created, I installed Debian (a Linux distribution) on which I installed Adguard Home.   
*-> TLDR : I installed several programs  for it to work on the computer I bought*  
- I set up my router so all my request go through my local DNS before it reaches the web so all the responses are filtered to and from the web.

Now I block a lot of ads, and I can monitor what devices access to which sites and which domain names are blocked. I'm glad I managed to do this.

I learned this on a course I had thanks to a teacher we had and I'm glad I was able to replicate this at home. If it's something you are interested in, DM me, I can help you set it up.

1fclpx3,Enough-Frosting7716,1725875934,My joyous car,"My car is 24 years old, a small car that I bought second hand for less than 1000 euros.

The motor works very well.

It has 3 different colors because some pieces on the front were replaced with scraps when i had a little happy accident.

The air conditioning doesnt work well, it only throws hot air, and even if you turn it down it still throws a little so the car becomes a furnace in the summer.
So I play with the windows, I have found a way opening 3 of them to various degrees, in which an air current goes through my legs and my body.
The two seats on the back can get horizontal so the space in the trunk becomes super big (i just fit laying there), so I can fit a lot of things if needed for my work (im a carpenter) or some personal proyect, even if the car is small. It is easy to park.
Sometimes for the longer trips, i bring a little spray bottle filled with cold water and ice, and I spray myself and the passengers and we cold ourselves that way.

Maybe one day before next summer i will fix the air conditioning now that I have money, if i do, I will miss the little spray bottle and the wind.
I just wanted to tell you how happy it makes me to appreciate having this car and all the freedom it allows me, and that I will run it to the end of times (or the car).

Whenever in a stoplight I see some big car that costs a 100 times mine, I just get happier, thinking how If i have that kind of money I will use it to buy land, or more land, or trees, or something of the same quality to be saved from the modern world.

1fch3kz,CommodoreCarbonate,1725855905,Advertising is pseudoscience.,"What is pseudoscience? According to MySportScience, pseudoscience can be summed up in six points:

# 1. Literature is aimed at the public. No review, no standards, no demand for accuracy and precision.

Name one company that considers ""accuracy and precision"" as something valuable in their advertising. Advertising thrives on underhanded tricks, lies, and deception. That is why companies are always paying fines and getting punished by the government(from Truth In Advertising). 

# 2. [Results cannot] be reproduced or verified. 

What sort of tests can one use to objectively determine the effectiveness of an ad? All available tests fail due to ***post hoc, ergo propter hoc.*** None of them can get around that and provide real evidence that advertising affects sales.

# 3. Failures are ignored, excused, hidden, lied about, discounted, explained away, forgotten.

When people point out the obvious failure of ads to get them to buy a specific product, apologists will lie and say ""That's not the point! The point is to get the product in your head so you'll think of it one day!""

There are serious problems with that idea. First of all, it's unfalsifiable. Second of all, it cannot explain any or all failed ad campaigns. Third of all, if that's the reason why you advertise, then why are you advertising a product and not your company's name itself?

# 4. No physical phenomena are ever found or studied, no progress is made, nothing concrete is learned.

Advertising never concerns anything physical or tangible. It's always psychological. They believe that they can use superstitious rituals to implant desires into people's brains.

# 5. Convinces by appeal to faith and belief.

In the absence of any sort of real, objective, verifiable evidence of the validity of marketers' claims, this is all they have when trying to convince companies to start ad campaigns.

# 6. [Generally earns] a living selling questionable products.

That's what advertising is, isn't it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1fch3kz/advertising_is_pseudoscience/,0,0.26,35,anticonsumption,/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1fch3kz/advertising_is_pseudoscience/,Ads/Marketing,,False,False,False,True,False,False,1728137566,

1f9azij,Blanconieves-Noci,1725501356,"This is about the environment and cigarettes. If you don't care, don't waste your time reading it.","I've quit cigarettes for over a month now. This might surprise you, considering how much I used to enjoy smoking. Cigarettes were a part of my daily routine for nine years, and I truly liked them. However, while I enjoy cigarettes, I love nature more. That’s why I do not want to buy another pack(I'm trying). During those nine years, I prided myself on being a responsible smoker. I never threw my cigarette butts in the street, believing that this small action was enough to protect the environment. But I’ve come to understand that the entire tobacco process from cultivation to packaging and delivery leaves a damaging footprint on our planet.

What’s even more concerning is the behavior of major tobacco companies like Philip Morris (Marlboro), British American Tobacco (Lucky Strike), and R.J. Reynolds (Camel and, yes, American Spirit). These companies have a long history of unnecessary and cruel animal testing, and they continue these practices today. Sadly, some people believe that American Spirit is a harmless, vegan option, but the truth is, purchasing this brand still supports R.J. Reynolds and their unethical practices. If quitting smoking is difficult, and you still choose to smoke, you might consider switching to a brand from Imperial Brands (like Golden Virginia or Davidoff), which, as far as we know, doesn’t engage in animal testing.

However, it’s important to remember that even these brands aren’t free from environmental impact. The tobacco industry is a significant contributor to pollution. It’s responsible for around 0.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions and has been linked to deforestation, water contamination, and air pollution. The World Health Organization has accused the industry of emitting millions of tons of carbon dioxide about 84 million metric tons—and opposing regulations on the plastic used in cigarette filters. The sheer amount of water used in tobacco production—22 billion liters further exacerbates climate change and deprives vulnerable populations of safe drinking water.

Compared to the average sugar consumer, a smoker’s impact on the environment is staggering. Smoking contributes almost five times more to water depletion, nearly ten times more to fossil fuel depletion, and four times more to climate change. The air pollution caused by cigarettes is ten times greater than that of diesel car exhaust you find it hard to quit smoking, I understand, and it’s commendable if you make an effort not to litter.

Advice is only useful if you have the right perception to use it 

Advice on how to be productive is only as useful as how much you care about being productive 

Advice on how to save or make money is only as useful as how much you care about money

You must be in a state of struggle or pain to  have the perception required to transcend your problem. Otherwise the advice you hear won’t stay in your mind. 

Just looking for advice without the perception to fully use and remember the advice is a waste of time. 

If you want something and you’re looking for advice to get it, look for the best perception to have instead. 

Do you just prefer to have more money or is it a goal you are willing to spend your life achieving? For example, the best possible advice on money won’t help unless you have the perception, skills and beliefs to achieve your monetary goals. 

All change requires an identity. You have to change who you are: your thoughts, goals and beliefs to change. Advice/tactics won’t work otherwise. 

This is why books and paid courses can be more useful because you have already got the perception to achieve your goals enough to spend money on the advice. But things like YouTube shorts and mindlessly looking for advice in the name of productivity just doesn’t work. 

Just trying to take up as much advice as you can won’t work unless it’s truly relevant to how you currently see your life. If you value the advice, make sure that you change your goals and perception so that you can actually utilise the advice.

Also, if you want to have the perception to use this advice or anyone else’s, check my profile out as you might find my posts help you change your perception and help you achieve your goals.

The fact that I keep hotel soaps, that I buy my food based on clearance/sale, use coupons, use an app for restaurant leftovers and grocery surplus, that I thrift or repair instead of replacing items. These were the norm for my childhood as a poor immigrant family. She can't understand why I do it now when my husband and I have a solid middle class income. 
She climbed the capitalist ladder and did very well for herself (I'm very proud of her for that). I don't begrudge her getting nice things for herself, she absolutely deserves it for the hard life she had and the hard work she put in. 

It's all the things she throws away that makes me feel icky. She now can't stand the sight of anything she thinks looks cheap, used, old.My bedroom in her home that I haven't lived in 9 years is essentially a guestroom and second closet. She replaced the normal middle class toilet, shower, and tub in there because they didn't ""look nice"", didn't even sell them or give them away, she just threw them out. She throws away so many things that are not only functional but in good and great condition because ""they're getting old"" aka she's had them too long. I suspect the amount of usable items she's thrown out at this point probably surpasses $10,000 USD.

She recently threw out a travel vest I stored at her house because it was ""cheap and ugly looking"". She doesn't understand why I'm upset, it was just $20, she doesn't understand why I'm upset about the wastefulness of it all.
I could've used it or given it to someone else who could, but now it's sitting in a landfill and I have to replace it. I've had talks with her before about donations and she says it isn't worth it because poor people still want nice things; when she was poor, she'd rather choose to go without rather than having a cheap or hand me down item.

I just don't see the point in being so wasteful, if I had wealth, I would sustainably travel and do charity work. Nothing about my home life would change besides maybe higher quality sustainable food.

When ever people bring up the idea that endless growth with no reason is harmful.

People say you want austerity. When Austerity comes from wanting line going up.

Degrowth should be properly called deemphsis growth. Where the insane need for economic growth for the sake of growth becomes growth.

Heck when did people decide that the purpose of the “economy” was to grow every year using a metric whose own creator said was a bad way to tell peoples happiness, anyway.

Heck the person who helped make the metic of GDP said that he didn’t want to use it as a all purpose measuring stick for the economy. It was made for the Great Depression/World War 2.

Degrowth means stopping environmental destructive industries that don’t contribute to human well being like smart phones every year or advertising.

It does not mean the very idea of “growth” is bad.

As a example instead of building environmental disasterous Suburbs people would instead build affordable apartments for the poor.

Instead of a Smart device that will be broke and thrown away you would have a highly modular phone like device that would last you six years.

The growth based austerity measures that cut welfare is the opposite of Degrowth

1f65w72,bingo-dingaling,1725164062,Stop trying to sell us bodies!,"---rant--- As we look at ads and social media (especially tiktok) in the last couple of years, we've seen the popularity of healthier, plumper, more realistic bodies die off and again get replaced with the super-skinny, unrealistic ""ideal"" body I had hoped we had finally buried forever this time. Waistline the size of my head, no body hair in sight, perpetually 20 years old... you know the one. It would take extreme interventions for anyone to whittle their body away into that ideal, and for most of us it would be impossible, or at least extremely unhealthy.

This is what it is - the perfect (read: unattainable) body will always be the ultimate fantasy to sell to the masses, because if corporations can keep us fixated on the desire to accomplish and maintain an impossible beauty standard, they can keep pressuring us to buy junk that promises to get us closer to that so-called perfect body we're all supposed to try for. We do immeasurable harm to out minds, our bodies, and eachother throughout this hopeless mission, all while profits expand.

All I needed was the pump. Another battery cap, also in the circle is always welcome. They are circled in red.

Everything that is not completely in the circle is unnecessary. Maybe we'll find a use for that thick cardboard box with the drawer. It could be useful for organizing small tools or something.

My old pump cracked and was out of warranty. So, this is an insurance replacement instead of a smaller box with just a refurbished pump, as I would get under warranty. It was the same model pump with the same documentation and accessories. It's not an upgrade. This is technology I've been using for years now. I didn't need that thick manual at the back left (which was in the drawer in the box) or any of the other documentation.

Maybe I can give away the blood glucose meter that talks to the pump since I don't like that brand and would rather just insert my number manually than have an inaccurate number transmitted automatically. I'll certainly try.

But, this drives me nuts!

1f512yq,Academic-Item4260,1725039153,Consumerism in Childhood,"My dad(73) grew up extremely impoverished, with no mother, and and a father who was 43 yo at his birth. All of his teeth rotted away and were pulled out by age 8. He was kicked out of school for too long of hair in 6th grade. He had a terrible diet of mostly hot dogs. He had his first slice of pizza in the Air Force at 18. 

I have heard these stories all my life and they are true. But the consumerism they have resulted in in my father is something I often battle. At 73, he still works a physical blue collar job. He is in debt, yet when he takes my son(6) for an afternoon visit, he returns home with $200 worth of toys. This happens every single time. His stress over debt leads my dad to be impatient, harsh, and unpredictable in his interactions. I do my best to explain to my son that just because his grandfather spends a lot of money does not mean he actually has a lot of money. I tell my dad to please stop buying so many toys. He is really harsh back to me when I ask this. 

The amount of toys is embarrassing to me when company comes over, or when my son has a playdate. I put toys in bins and rotate them. But today I took a stand and told my son that his grandpa won’t be buying him toys anymore unless it is for Christmas or a birthday. Now I have to tell my dad and face that backlash. 

I struggle with loneliness as a SAHM. Most days I am super happy to be home with my kids educating them. (I homeschool my son). But the days when the toys are everywhere and when I am also lonely really bother me. I end up yelling at my kids about picking up toys instead of spending time taking them to the museum or working art or school. The stuff everywhere is so distracting. I hate it. 

*Deep breath*

Today I helped my kids tidy their room and I told them that we have enough. I told them I want them to practice saying to themselves, “I have enough” when they see something they want.

I told them that if they can practice that phrase, then I can practice saying to myself, “I do not need to yell. I do not need to get angry.”

1f4vba0,orcusvoyager1hampig,1725024647,Ultimate Junk Mail Removal Guide,"Junk mail is awful. It's wasteful, it's annoying, it's consumeristic to be constantly advertised to through every medium possible as a captive audience, often the ads are deceptive (the worst is when they are disguised to appear as bills). I've been on a mission to remove as much junk mail as possible.

1. Enroll in DMAChoice.
   1. It's worth every penny.
   2. Safe to use - official method listed by the FTC's website.
2. Enroll in optoutprescreen.
   1. Free, will stop credit card offers.
   2. Safe to use - provided by credit bureaus and listed by the FTC's website.
3. Opt out of data brokers.
   1. Directly reach out to known data brokers and follow their opt out processes.
   2. For example, some bureaus, insurance companies, or other financial services ""share"" their info with third parties. Opt out directly with the company, or with the data broker.
4. Opt out of coupon/ad catalogs for your market.
   1. Example of a big one would be Vericast, opt out at their ""save"" website.
   2. Inspect the backside of the coupon or ad catalog if you receive from a different vendor and google their opt out site.
5. Use a middleman to opt out.
   1. If directly opting out doesn't work, there are a couple services that ""opt out for you"" either by scanning the mail or by allowing your info. YMMV. I've had best success directly opting out.
6. Contacting companies directly.
   1. First step is to call a relevant 1-800 or customer service number and ask to be removed from the mailing list.
   2. If that doesn't work, place the mail in your OWN stamped evelope, write a note to be removed from a mailing list, and send back to the return address.
      1. It is important you **don't** write ""return to sender"", but that you place it in your OWN envelope - most junk mail is sent as presort standard, and presort standard is trashed by the USPS if it is received back.
   3. If that doesn't work, place the mail in your OWN stamped enevelop, write a note, and send to the corporate headquarters, with ATTN: marketing department or ATTN: corporate secretary.
7. File an FTC complaint.
   1. Once you've gone through the above and contacted the company in a couple ways, file an FTC complaint for unsolicited mail.
   2. Wait a few weeks for them to respond or process through mail that's already been sent out.
8. Fill out USPS Form 1500 for a Prohibitory Order.
   1. This is the most extreme option. The USPS allows you to file a legal form to stop ""pandering advertisements"" - explicit mailings. But, there is Supreme Court case law upholding the fact that only the RECEIVER can determine what is explicit (Rowan V USPS for more info) and does not need to justify the reason. If you have exhausted all options, this is the last resort.
   2. I haven't used this option yet since all options above have worked.

Honestly, if you do the above diligently for just a few months in your spare time, you've cut out 99% of your junk mail.

The idea that your knees will combust if you don’t have the perfect running shoe is just so odd. It’s reaching propaganda standards at this point. 

The Hokas with three inches of padding on them are ridiculous too. Have Hoka fans ever considered that running in shoes like that is very unnatural? It doesn’t completely absorb the force you create, it redistributes it to different parts of your body. 

There are people that run barefoot and in shoes with no padding that do fine. I know I’m going off on a tangent that isn’t really pertaining to the quantity of shoes bought, but I think it’s about more than that.

1f4jg62,Terminating12,1724981944,Advice on how to remake a broken plastic part from my ice maker,"
Hey everyone,

I’ve got a broken plastic part in my fridge’s ice maker. It's the part at the bottom where the ice cubes are actually made. The issue is that I only need to replace this small plastic piece, but the manufacturer only sells it bundled with the motor and other components I don’t need, which feels really wasteful.

The plastic piece I need to remake has to be strong enough to hold the ice cubes, but it also needs to flex a bit when the fridge releases the cubes so they can drop down. This means it needs to withstand a lot of pressure and weight without breaking. What material would be best? How do I make a good mold for it?

Instead of buying the whole assembly, I’m thinking about trying to remake just the plastic part myself. Does anyone here have experience with this? What’s the best way to create a mold and reproduce this part at home? Any tips or resources would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!

**TL;DR:** I need to remake a broken plastic part from my ice maker that only comes with an expensive bundle. It needs to be strong but also flexible. Looking for advice on how to create a mold and reproduce it at home.

I feel like it's a necessary response to the over-consumption of the last decade. They talk about keeping or re-using your items, only buying what you need/run out of, thrifting, sharing among family and friends, etc.

However, as a middle-aged person, I was also a young adult during the 2008 housing meltdown and recession, and I'm seeing a lot of similarities to that time. During and after the recession, the hipster subculture rose up. The hipsters worked very low-level, entry service jobs to get enough money to pretty much live and party. They were always living with 4 roommates illegally somewhere and wearing lots of thrifted clothes and throwing ragers with cheap beer. The mood was very much ""f-it"" since everyone was just scraping by anyway. We didn't shop or care about consuming, the coolest people always had an outfit they stole from their dad or grandma's rejects and mixed with American Apparel clearance items.

I'm seeing that this vibe might be coming back again. Everyone even says ""indie sleeze"" is coming back into fashion (although no one I knew called it that at the time). If you have very little chance of ""making it"" (buying a house, having kids, getting a good job), why bother trying? Do you agree this sort of cycle might be coming back?

Edit: hello all!  I believe consumption is an integral part of capitalism. I also believe that it’s important to understand thoroughly things that we may be against. This video/movie explains, very thoroughly, the history of capitalism from a realist/Marxist perspective. The main theme is the current devastation of South American rainforests via the same mentality that led us to mono crops, genocide, fossil fuels, etc..  To me it’s a clearer view of not only the genocide of the indigenous American but the genocide of the Palestinians, currently. It’s simply a view into the system that capitalism has to offer.

1f0xqe6,koenigsbier,1724596472,This is the story of a 40-year-old microwave that never worked,"

I visited my new uncle's house this weekend and because I have a baby, one of the first thing he told me is his microwave oven only purpose is, for the moment, ornamentation. He then proceeded to tell me the story.

Around 40 years ago my grand parents bought it for him as a gift. But turns out it has a defect and doesn't work as it doesn't warm food up and the plate doesn't turn as well (sorry, I lack a bit of English vocabulary here). When he told that to his parents they were quite vexed. They took it personally like it was their fault they bought a garbage-like device. They brought it back to the shop but the salesperson told them it was working fine even though it wasn't the truth.

So, in order not to create even more drama, my uncle kept it in its box all those years until a few months ago when he finally moved in his own house (he lived in tiny rental appartements all his life).

He told me now that he's retired (since last month) he will finally have time to open it, check what's wrong and finally repair it (thanks to his now-former job he knows quite well about electricity and electronics).

I personally think in 40 years he had plenty of time to repair it however I find it cool he didn't throw it away and kept it all those years.

1f1bnjp,catlinac,1724633494,Anyone else struggle to break free?,"

I came to this sub because I want to live a different lifestyle, both for ethical reasons and because of financial need.

I’ve always been depressed by commodity fetishism and felt horror at the way we are alienated from the human suffering and natural destruction in the products we buy.

But at the same time, objects are important to me, and I enjoy getting new things. I don’t want to, but I do. I’m on the spectrum and objects are comforting. I love finding new things for my space that make it feel more cozy. And I really struggle with used items which trigger strong bad feelings especially clothes or anything personal; it’s like I can feel the person who had it before.

I want to work on this and teach myself new habits of not finding comfort in objects and getting new things so I came to this sub, but I feel like there are a lot of people posting very judgmental and morally superior posts about how revolted they are by plushies, plastic figures, etc. I get that these things are unnecessary and harmful to the earth but it seems like there’s a lot of spite towards people who struggle to stop buying.

Is there anyone else who is in the same boat? Who wants to be better but doesn’t find it so easy?

And is there a little kindness and compassion for those of us who do want to change but find it hard? Or should I just feel horrible about myself and give up? 🫣

1f0twht,,1724584151,Spending money on myself feels incredibly useless ,"Is there anyone who feels like me? I have been thinking about why I am /think this way and I came to the conclusion that it must be my upbringing. I grew up with 6 siblings who are similar in age. During my childhood and teenage years we were always short on money because my parents were paying off the house they bought, and well 7 children also bring in costs.

Some of my siblings were more dominant on when they wanted to have something but I always felt guilty  for asking for anything. In primary school I never had the cool toys everyone had but my mum did her best to try to find similar alternatives in flea markets and even now at 22 I never ever went shopping for clothes ever. My mum had/has a lot of friends with daughters of similar ages and I always got the clothes they didn't want to wear anymore. Even now, I still own and wear clothes that I also wore in the 7th grade.

When I was in my teens (14-18 yrs) I always fantasized of all the stuff I want to buy when I make enough money but now? Now that I can afford it, everything just seems useless. I look at a cute product and I think : 'it's cute but it will just lie around anyway'.

Growing up I always when I saw something that I liked, had this mentality of : ""When I have the money I'll buy it"" And I think that through that I learned that a lot of things I wanted to have were just very temporary and not necessary at all. 

When I accompany my siblings when they go shopping I am not interested in clothes at all although I know that my clothes are not trendy, simply because I don't see clothes in a fashionable way but more in a useable way which I find weird because I remember specifically that when I was in 8th-10th grade I swore myself to buy trendy clothes and be cool when I can afford it.

I also don't spend money on makeup because I never had interest in it. All the money I ever spend is on gifts I randomly buy for my parents and siblings when I spot stuff that I know they like/wanted. The only thing I could think of that I spend money on for myself are CD's from the flea market that cost around 50cent- 2 euros depending on the artist/seller.

1eykv44,,1724337236,Remember the shopping habits of the 90s and 2000s?,"I was just musing to my husband about how much shopping has changed. I lived in the rural Midwest growing up, and we just honestly didn't have access to much of anything store-wise. The nearest mall was about an hour away, and we had a Shopko, a Wal-Mart, a Fleet Farm (yes, it has clothes) and a Fashion Bug in town. 

You would only go to those stores if your parents needed something there, and you could only look at anything else if they had time and they let you do that. If you couldn't get an item at those stores, you likely weren't getting it. My parents only went to the mall for very specific things they couldn't get in town, so only about once per year, maybe. And our mall didn't have a lot of the ""hot"" brands of the time, either, since we lived in a smaller market. 

I remember ripping pictures out of magazines of a lip gloss that I really wanted, and then having to wait for 2-3 months for the opportunity to even see it, much less get it. This was normal back then for people not living near a major city or shopping center. You really loved and appreciated what you had, as you really fought for those items and truly loved them.

1ey5rku,ReasonableRevenue164,1724286755,Overconsumption of Meat,"Hello all. 

I've seen much discussion about overconsumption of things, but not of creatures.

I implore you to be consistent in your beliefs towards consumption and animal rights. Most people love their pets, yet are quite comfortable eating creatures that have the same level of cognition as their pets.

I practice a reduced meat diet. I am not militant about eating meat, as perhaps vegans are, however, I do not purchase meat for myself- only for my family.  If they may not finish a large dish (say ground beef for tacos) I'd eat that as I rather not have the animal go to waste.

Think, perhaps, that meat does not need to be eaten at every meal; that the Jerky you eat as a casual snack came from a creature that lived (if mass farmed) in terrible, tortured conditions. 

Be consistent.

I like to clean and nothing is as satisfying as cleaning the often missed/ignored spots and bringing a whole new refreshment to it.

The windowsills and the tightly gapped cracks under the counters where my broom didnt fit and the vacuum lacked power was especially challenging.

This hack used a dirt 😈 style hand vacuum, and cut a plastic water bottle in half, and using the top, secured with scotch tape to the vaccuum, created the perfect attachment to get in those tight spaces.

On a cleaning craze I came to need to make one, and I had a thick dish soap bottle ready to cut and reuse, and was about to reach for the tape, when heating gun crossed my mind, and so I bust out the heating gun, and got to work morphing, melting and fitting that plastic moulding it to a nearly perfect fit on the vaccuum.

You can sit anywhere there is a bench or a little stone wall, everything is beautiful, socializing and being alone in nature are 5 minutes apart, and the children are always running in bikes gathering wood to build something or make a fire.

Developers buy up perfectly fine homes and buildings, tear them down, and build some new cookie cutter McMansion, office building, chain store, or apartment building. I understand that towns and cities change all the time, and change is inevitable. But it's so wasteful and soulless. 

One of my friends had his father pass away last year. He had been taking care of his dad and living with him in their family home that he had grown up in and lived in almost his entire life. Due to a number of circumstances he had to sell the house even though he really didn't want to. It really hurt him to have to do it, and he agonized over the decision. But it ultimately became his only choice. The sale just went through a couple of months ago, and he just posted pictures showing that it's already been demolished. The developer who bought it already has a listing with pictures of a mockup of the ridiculous McMansion that's going up in its place. 

It's bad enough that house flippers are buying and gutting older family homes and turning them into bland grey and white living spaces that look exactly like a million other houses on the market right now. But it makes me even madder that people are destroying perfectly good houses just to build something ""new and modern"" using inferior materials and shoddy workmanship. There's nothing unique or interesting about any of these new builds. They all look nearly identical. And some of these old neighbors have zero soul or character anymore. 

What a waste. Not just in materials and labor, but it's also a waste of the charm, warmth, and character that some of these older homes and buildings had. I'm not talking about the ones that are in rough shape and can't really be fixed, or the ones that may have been built with dangerous materials. But plenty of perfectly good buildings have been sacrificed to the gods of real estate and commerce.

Judy commented on this post:  
""Why do they keep over baking?""  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Then Eric replied to Judy:  
'It is important to grocery stores to always have product on their shelves... ALWAYS. They would rather overstock their shelves and throw out unsold product rather than allow the shelves go bare until the next shipment comes in. It is bad for grocery stores' image for them to run out of anything and have their customers complain that they have run out of stock of whatever item they're there to purchase. Would you go to a grocery store with the intent of buying certain products if you suspected that that grocery store might not have the item you want in stock? Grocery stores would rather discard unsold stock than lose the faith, loyalty and patronage of their customers. It's cheaper for them to throw out until product than to lose a single customer.

Does this policy create ""food waste""? Perhaps, but as long as we have the efforts of folks like Pam, that ""waste"" is getting into the hands of folks who may not be able to afford to pay full retail for those items in the store. So from a certain point of view, it's a good thing.'  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Then Savannah replied to Eric:  
""this was a really on point comment until the very end! I wish that were true, but look at any dumpster and you’ll see that there are not nearly enough Pams in the world or even in Atlanta to rescue all of this thrown away bread. The amount that Pam and JT rescue is fantastic and commendable and impactful, but it’s just a drop in the bucket in the depressing amount of wasted food every day.'

Bingo Eric: Grocery stores STAY STOCKED.   

Have any of y'all ever, even 1 time in your life, walked into ANY grocery store (Publix, Kroger, etc) ... ANYwhere in this country ... at ANY time (any season of the year, any day of the week, any time of the day), ... and they are out of, say, oranges?  No, you have NOT.  

Not only do they have oranges in stock, ... they have AN ENTIRE MOUNTAIN of them available for you to choose from! 

And, just in case someone comes in at closing and buys all the oranges available in that MOUNTAIN, the store has another entire truckload of oranges scheduled to be delivered the very next morning! 

Note that on the 99.99999999% of the days that nobody came the night before to buy up all the remainder of yesterday's truckload of oranges, those remaining oranges from yesterday are then all tossed into the dumpster out back, in order to make room for today's oranges.   
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
And have y'all noticed that grocery stores keep getting bigger?  

It takes a lot of space (cu ft) to  
A) not only CARRY all the various (many!) products that the industrialized food production system is churning out these days, but also to  
B) STOCK LARGE\*\* AMOUNTS of each.

\*\*LARGE = LARGE-ENOUGH that no customer is ever disappointed by an OUT OF STOCK situation!  

We started calling them supermarkets as they expanded to cater to consumer appetites for MORE and DIFFERENT.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Some of you may be old enough to remember when there were just a few kinds of cereal in the marketplace: Cheerios, corn flakes, rice krispies, wheaties.  Representing the 4 major grains: oats, corn, rice, wheat.  With maybe a few fun variations thrown in: corn pops, raisin bran.  What more would one need?  

Well, capitalism has, with dogged perseverance, been answering that question over the past 50 years with a resounding ""Lots more!"" 

Now the cereal aisle alone in any grocery store is as big as a football field!    
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Each grocery store in the U.S. is scrambling to  
1) carry as many products as possible, ...   
  and to   
2) ensure that each and every 1 of those products STAYS IN STOCK.

If a particularly large amount of some given product in the store happens to get bought by customers on a given day, then the store wants to make sure to still have enough of that product on hand for OTHER CUSTOMERS to buy.  

That's a lot of food (truckfuls!) coming in every day ... and a lot of the previous shipment of each and every item going out the back, destined for landfill.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Granted, inventory management is a difficult challenge... and even more difficult for those inventory items that are perishable, ugh.  

But, as long as the consumers keep demanding what they want when they want it, it's a challenge that the U.S. grocery stores ... er, supermarkets ... these days seem to be deeming worthwhile to meet, no matter the cost to the environment or society.

I didn't see the tree(s) get planted, grown for years, chopped down, trucked away with big trucks, milled, wrapped in plastic, put on another truck, driven to the store with more gas, etc. etc.

To me, I just ""used a paper towel"" without thinking about it.

And that's just before I consumed.  Now the process basically has to get reversed: more trucks, maybe landfill, maybe incinerator, who really knows.

All these things are happening all the time just for a paper towel and there isn't a word for it?

Currently live in a household were finances are often tough even few days after payday.

I've seen the sub really promote a minimalist lifestyle- especially with buying more than you need.

The thing is though, I often wait for mega sales during the year to buy none perishables. For instance Black Friday and clearance sales are when I buy most of my soaps and toiletries.

Doing so lasts me the year but it often means I have to purchase things like those sorting baskets and such similar to the ones that have been trending on social media.

It also means at least once a year I have an insane amount of trash after the bulk buying. An amount I fear is more than it would have been had I bought things like refills.

So I was just wondering.

This was so frustrating and disturbing to me because I'd see something I liked but didn't need at the moment but I knew if I didn't buy it NOW it would be gone in the coming days or weeks. I have no clue what they even do with the remaining stock of things they take back. After I noticed this selling tactic I found that so many other brands do this as well, even those that claim sustainability.

It used to be that if something you owned broke or wore out you could go buy it again, now it's if you don't buy it right this moment it might be gone the next time you come in to shop so you might as well buy it now. I would understand maybe if only physical stores did this to rotate stock, but they pull entire lines out of the website every few months as well.

It was so disheartening seeing flimsy plastic waste arrive and then see them in the sale section the next month. The quality of the clothes are bad because they produce them so quickly, they follow fleeting microtrends (bows were huge for a few months) that get shelved a few months later, and there is an unfathomable amount of clothing waste being produced. If one store operates like this I can't imagine the amount of waste produced by all other stores, and other chains, and globally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1ev49jl/corporations_using_false_scarcity_to_sell_and/,180,0.98,10,anticonsumption,/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1ev49jl/corporations_using_false_scarcity_to_sell_and/,Corporations,,1723973238.0,False,False,True,False,False,1728137566,

1eup6l8,pajamakitten,1723921175,The energy drink market is insane.,"I went food shopping this morning and it seems more and more like energy drinks are just accepted as normal, much like soda and juice is. Monster has a new flavour out, which I only know because it is being advertised heavily by the tills. You see billboards and hear ads on Spotify for the likes of Red Bull, Monster, Lucozade etc. Even the litter near me has a lot of discarded Red Bull cans in amongst it.

Sale is prohibited for under 16s here because of the health concerns around them, yet you still see kids drinking them all the time because they are seen as cool. Heavy sponsorship with athletes helps normalise that too. Back when I was teaching, you would hear kids as young as seven or eight saying they are drinking them in the morning (because they are up all night on their Xbox). 

It blows my mind that they have gone from being something needed by athletes and diabetics to something that we see as normal because people feel they need a huge pick me up, sometimes several a day, due to caffeine addiction.

1ev38hn,Strawberrybanshee,1723964615,Its Halloween season.... help!,"Alright, so I'm usually very good about low consumption. I am usually able to only buy the things I need.

But I have one weakness. Halloween. It's my favorite. On top of that, I also love horror movies, and I'm Goth adjacent, and best way I can describe that is I listen to Goth music, but I listen to way more punk and emo so I wouldn't really call myself goth? Unless there is a word that is a combo for all three. (lol maybe just alt). 

Its spooky season and shelves are already filling up with cute Halloween decorations. I've been doing pretty good at not buying this year but I did have a moment of weakness and did buy one decoration.

So my plan is to only shop second hand. Whether it be on facebook market place or thrift stores. For the rest of the season I'm going to do my best to buy second hand. Maybe I'll even get to the courage to make tiktoks of things I bought second hand. Its going to be hard because I can't seem to avoid advertisement for new decor.

So wish me luck. 

I also want to add, a few years ago I worked at a Spirit of Halloween. There was a ridiculous amount of waste. If Spirit lost the licenses to sell a brand, we had to destroy all those products. At the end of the season, all discontinued products had to be destroyed so no one would go to the dumpster and steal them. Their logic was that it could have been a sale. I hated it. There was so much unsold stuff that went to the dumpster.

1euvafu,becomealamp,1723937692,Methods in which I save paper as a student and artist,"I love school, drawing, journaling, and writing, all of which require paper. However, I try my best to reduce waste and consuming, and I’m especially passionate about saving paper (not sure why LOL). so here are some methods in which I avoid buying paper products:

1. scavenge other peoples notebooks

i dont know about yalls experience, but on the last days of school, people would often throw away their composition notebooks for a particular subject, often only using a small portion of the book. on those days i would go around and ask people for the notebooks they were going to throw away. sometimes i would go into the recycling bin, but i try not to anymore because i dont want to invade peoples privacy by looking at their writing without permission. i have a huge collection of composition notebooks now, and i use them heavily. i dont think ive bought a new notebook in years. if i use them for school, i simply rip out the used pages. if i use them for personal purposes, i wont even rip out the used pages as i can often draw/write in the margins. its honestly very satisfying to finish the notebook.

2. collect semi-used paper

i dont do this much anymore as i have far more paper than i need lol, but in middle school when i looked for drawing paper i would take paper that had only used one side out of the recycling bin by the printer or just ask people for it. i would poke holes into it and clip it into a binder and that was where i practiced drawing! unless i need to give it to someone, if i need a scrap piece of paper i always go to the stack of “blank on one side” papers i have in my bedroom. 

 3. scrap booking

i gotta say im a sentimental person and i love to save my drawings, but it’s difficult to save them when they are just a bunch of loose papers. luckily, i have an extensive book collection with MANY ruined books. i would pick a book that is ruined (ripped pages, weathered paper, etc.) or a used math practice notebook or whatever that i wont read anymore and no thrift store would accept and glue my drawings into them to create sort of a fake sketchbook. 

4. “everything” notebooks

dont get me wrong, i do like to keep things organizied, but if im not writing anything particularly important down i like to put it in my “everything” notebook. this includes doodles, writing, notes, etc. all combined. not only do i not have to lug around a bunch of notebooks, but i can optimize space in the notebooks as well.
i can draw something and then write my grocery list in the margins. im aware this doesnt work for everyone but its an easy way to optimize materials for me. 

5. thrift store notebooks

finally, this does require buying something of course, but at thrift stores there are a surprisingly amount of unused or hardly used notebooks. honestly its exciting to get these notebooks because occasionally youll find things from the previous owner and give yourself a peek into someones life. ive found some cool notebooks as well- i found one with a real leather cover and handmade paper! 

some of these are only practical for some people of course, but i have barely bought any paper products in years and its satisfying to do little things to reduce consumption and waste :>
its also super fun to create art from paper and products that would otherwise end up in the bin. gives me such a satisfied feeling.

He might also have a huge album collection. Whereas the creator expresses himself creatively with writing or music.

It's an extremely specific and wasteful appliance that I'm not going to use all that often, and the only thing it can do is make a sugary dessert that I don't need. 

Except! I got it because it's now possible for me to make small batches for myself at home from common raw ingredients, and it's an appliance I expect to maintain for about ten years. I got it because I was getting frustrated at having to buy too-large quantities from the store for my needs, and it always getting ruined by defrosting and refreezing before I could finish it, wasting food and packaging. This felt like a better solution than only getting single-serve packages.

None of my family members use that type of stuff, so they just continue to stay by the shower.

1eptseq,Mciron95,1723406006,Just an idea that I need help flourishing ,"**Ladies and Gentlemen,**

The world you see today is not a product of fate—it's a consequence of choices made by those who came before us, and it's shaped by the choices we make now. We've inherited a world filled with outdated ideologies, corrupt systems, and the scars of history’s mistakes. But we are not powerless in the face of this legacy. We are the common people, the backbone of society, and together, we possess an extraordinary power—the power to change everything.

Look around you. The world’s most powerful empires, the vast corporations, and the governments that seem untouchable—they are not forces of nature. They are constructs, built and sustained by human hands, by the very people who now suffer under their weight. It’s time we remember that we, the commoners, the workers, the dreamers, are the true architects of our world. We have the power to reshape it, to tear down the old and build something new, something better, something that reflects our values, our hopes, and our vision for the future.

For too long, we’ve been told to accept the world as it is. To believe that we must fit into a system that benefits the few at the expense of the many. But why should we accept the scraps they leave us when we can build our own table? Why should we allow ourselves to be shackled by the past, when the future is ours to create?

Consider the revolutions that have changed the course of history. The American Revolution, the French Revolution—these were not the work of kings or queens, but of ordinary people who decided that enough was enough. They seized their power and rewrote the rules. And today, we stand on the brink of our own revolution—not one of bloodshed, but of ideas, of unity, of unstoppable momentum.

When we stand together, we are an unstoppable force. When we demand change, the world must listen. It is our hands that build the homes, our minds that create the innovations, our voices that carry the dreams of generations. And when we choose to rise, to stand up and say, ""This is not the world we want,"" we tap into a power that can topple empires, that can dismantle the greed and corruption that have taken root in our societies.

We don’t have to accept what they leave us with. We don’t have to play by their rules. The world does not belong to the few who hoard wealth and power—it belongs to all of us. And together, we can make it a world where justice, equality, and compassion reign. A world where every person is valued, where our environment is protected, and where the true potential of humanity can flourish.

We must recognize our own power. We must see that the change we seek begins with each of us, with our choices, our actions, our voices. When we come together, when we unite in purpose and in spirit, we can create a world that reflects what we choose—not what they leave us with.

This is our moment. This is our time to rise, to take back the power that is rightfully ours, and to forge a future that belongs to all of us. We have the power to change the world. Let’s use it.

1endqjx,vince_vanGoNe,1723142383,A message to all the old f*cks who don’t care,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this but I just need to rant and feel like you guys get it. 

I’ve just moved into a new place, renting from a landlord that just bought the property. The old owners left behind a bunch of junk, as well as gardening equipment, planters, lumber, scrap wood, pavers and stones. Basically all stuff that kind of accumulates as you work on around a house. I’m cheap and was happy to grab a couple things for myself as I knew the landlords were planning on just throwing it all out. (Infuriating but only half the reason I’m ranting)  

I’m young, and I work in waste reduction for my municipality so I of course said something. The one old man landlord said it would be useless to do anything than throw it out because no one wants to buy this kind of thing and said he’d have to give it away and doesn’t want to deal with all that (this is as they’re spending 3 days and who knows how much filling a 20ft dumpster). Fine whatever, it’s his property I guess. 

Then I tell him later that hey, don’t mean to hover I just work in waste reduction so I’m going to want to save what I can. And then this old guy tells me about how he dropped out of his phD in the 80s to join a waste reduction and recycling coop, taking apart household appliances and separating materials for reuse and recycling. Awesome! But then the recession in the 90s happened and everyone stopped caring about the environment. He went on to describe his other jobs (housing co-op, church office, really painting a picture of a guy who dropped out of college tbh) and ended his story with what he learned: None of it made a difference. He worked for years and theres still global warming so none of it mattered. 

HUHHH?!?!!? 

I am so flipping sick of these old people telling me how useless my job is for one, and for two how much it doesn’t make a difference. Just cause you were young and full of yourself and couldn’t “fix the world” it doesn’t mean it didn’t make a difference. And why would you feel fine saying that? Something so discouraging to a young person? What a stupid stupid outlook on your life and the world. And now because of your unrealistic expectations you had when you were young you’ve decided to preach a message of despair. TBH I know nothing I do will make a dent in the state of the climate, but it doesn’t mean I won’t do it. Theres other motivations for reducing waste, like basic care of local environment, or how our province is actually running out of landfill space. (Which I said to him and his solution is to do what the states does and put it on a train and send it to communities that need industry. I just shook my head) 
I really wish I had said something like this to him, but he just seemed to be so happy to share what he learned in his life and I was a bit too shocked to speak.

Whereas here it's centered around consumerism. What you've bought. ""NBD!"" The bicycling subreddit proudly displays a...completely normal bike with zero context.

Maybe it's a marketing team just taking a model off a floor and taking a photo for some attempt to garner interest, but the sheer *volume* of this is interesting.

When I point this out in a tangential way in /r/bicycling, and mention there's this youtuber who's kinda anticonsumerist and generally against 'random junk' that manufacturers and bike shops sell to riders (Which isn't to their advantage), people in the subreddit get *very* defensive.

*******

This mindset extends even further in video games. Say, /r/Helldivers. A game where you start with the best equipment, and then unlock stuff that's meant to be 'on-par' with it and (roughly) be analogous to prevent ""power creep"" where new players are locked out.

Overall, a pretty classic style of balance that's taken by some of the industry greats (Valve). Nothing unusual from my POV.

Except on that subreddit, I bump into players who are so mentally ground down by microtransactions and seasonal passes that they are shocked, *shocked* and dismayed, I tell you, when a game doesn't grant an easier win when they unlock different equipment that enables different playstyles. They demand that the toughest difficulties be ""a roflstomp"" because ""we ground up to level 20 and unlocked these things with in-game currency or bought them with real world money, we should be able to-"" (keep in mind, you can get to level 150. There's no power advantage, it's just a meaningless rank. Unlocking weapons enables different playstyles, not necessarily more powerful ones.)

The commenters in threads stamp feet and curse the developers and studio in all-caps over their unlocked weapons being nerfed to match the original equipment when players find ways to use the unlocked equipment in ways that remove all the challenge from the game. It's hard to not see an overgrown baby that has an adult's wallet pitching an absolute fit.

I genuinely see such an amount and volume of whining I just can't believe what I'm looking at- surely people can't all be so demanding that ""OMG I PAID FOR THIS UNLOCK WHY AM I NOT INSTA-WINNING???"" And yet I'm staring right at it.

People are comfortable with ""pay to win,"" and this kind of brainrot seems to also cause them to flip an absolute shit and throw a tantrum whenever anything gets changed or nerfed.

I genuinely think consumerism has wrecked peoples' ability to be mature adults.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1emxtxn/i_feel_like_i_dont_belong_on_reddit/,48,0.77,36,anticonsumption,/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1emxtxn/i_feel_like_i_dont_belong_on_reddit/,Social Harm,,1723094873.0,False,False,True,False,False,1728137566,

I made it a priority and finally got a card, and they use Libby! This app delivers books directly to my kindle and then automatically takes them back when they are due or I can return them early. If I don’t finish, I can re-check a book out or renew if there are no other holds and it will have all my progress, highlights, and notes saved. 

I found tons of books to put on my hold list so every few days another one is available. If I can’t read it yet, I let the next person in line read it and set a “deliver later than” date. 

I have a new job now with better hours, and I’ve read 22 books in 10 weeks. No money, no gas, just learning and entertainment without ads. All paid for with tax dollars I owe anyways. It’s been better than I could have imagined it would be. I’ve even managed to collect other “library cards” I am eligible for outside of my city’s library, so I have even more books.

If not forgotten, it will grow stronger along with our other knowledge through time.

What we have gathered over the last hundred thousand years grants us powers and abilities that if our ancestors could witness our might, they would wonder if we might one day approach omnipotence ourselves.  
Return life to the dead?  We dabble.  
Cure the sick?  Check.  
Fly so high we touch the Sun?  The Parker Solar Probe will come as close as 3.83 million miles to the Sun, well within the orbit of Mercury and about seven times closer than any spacecraft has come before.  
Bring about life itself, assembling lifeless chemicals into something that survives, changes, feeds, and multiplies?  We actually have done that, though we cheated some by copying our blueprint from a germ that we sliced away all extra features from its DNA that were not directly responsible for its survival.  
Part a sea?  Well that is beyond us but we can sure blast a lot of water out of the way for a few seconds.  
Flood the whole world?  The oceans are already rising, folks.  We know that CO2 traps heat on Earth, like your car windows trap heat enough that we can barely grip the wheel.  It is not like we are just making up stories to scare you, you see that rolling up windows traps heat, you feel its deadly power.  You believe it.

Now believe this, because we have sharp eyes and keen senses, we KNOW that human activities have raised the atmosphere's carbon dioxide content by 50% in less than 200 years.  
Let me put it this way for those of Faith:  We dam a river God placed there, and we can replace land with a new Lake.   Boosting CO2 by 50% is like damming ALL of the rivers so that the water level rises by 50%  But we are not flooding the world with cool, refreshing water.  We are flooding it with a Hellish inferno of air so hot, that if you were naked, soaked, and fanned to limit of evaporation from your body for cooling, you would still die of heat stroke.  (google wet bulb) We are rolling up the windows of Earth, and every dog, baby, any of God's creatures we leave on Earth should curse the Willful Blindness of Man as their souls are cooked out of their bodies.

You think God will save you?  Did you not just radically alter what he has wrought, with nary a by-your-leave-milord?  Are you not, even at this moment, closing the eyes he worked so hard to provide you with?  Ignoring the cliff you walk toward, so cocky in your pride that you think Gravity itself would not dare to pull you to your demise at the bottom of a ravine?  Gravity that God made perfect the first time, you now think you are wiser than Him, and He will flick the switch to turn it off, even as you plumet to your death?

If I were God, I would conclude that you WANT to die.  I would feel it a mercy, to grant you your desire.  Start over with orangutans this time.  Put a big eternal sign up saying ""DO NOT MESS WITH THERMOSTAT!.""

Well Lord, I tried.  No use pointing out the nose on people's faces after they have removed their eyeballs because they don't like what they see.  If I keep pushing, the fools will slice their noses off just to spite me.  Rant over, ye blind men.  I am not so far-seeing myself, since I intend to laugh at you all while we burn, glad that the Universe was wisely built in such a way that the trash takes itself out.

1ek09db,Maleficent-Smile-221,1722791340,TikTok and overconsumption ,"Yes I know TikTok is the breeding ground for overconsumption with influencers really buying the most ridiculous amount of items that serve no purpose. Once I saw people in the book space literally choosing the iPad mini (while they already had a working e reader) because the iPad has colours.

But does anyone else , as an audience/consumer, find TikTok even more addicting than other social media? It’s more easy to influence?

I realised on TikTok I can literally waste so much time and I will literally be more prone to wanting to buy whatever new item they are shilling. But on Instagram, where there is no shortage of influencers and short form content, the effect is not so much? I realised this with makeup, I frequently get makeup content on both, but TikTok seems to have much more of an impact? I’m more likely to search up a product if I’ve seen it on TikTok instead of any other platform. 

I just wanted to ask if anyone feels the same or if it’s just me being odd 🥲 and for my mental sanity, my wallet and to reduce waste, I uninstalled TikTok.

1eiv7dy,0ddumn,1722661620,Can we just take a minute to talk about the baby industry?,"I’m a new mom with a 7 month old, and I am still just absolutely amazed by all the baby stuff that’s marketed as essential. I feel like I’m the only one who parents the way I do (so far) and I’m constantly gawking at the things my friends get for their babies or that people online claim as “essential.” The baby swings, the wipe warmers, the toys, the 100 different car seat and stroller contraptions, the changing tables, the sound machines, the high tech monitors, the fancy diaper pails. And I mean hey, if a couple of these things makes the transition to parenthood easier and works for your family, cool!! But I swear most people just seem to get them because they were told that they’re necessary, that it’s just a part of having a baby, and that they never even thought to question it. 

If I told my friends that all they really needed for a newborn is a safe sleep space, feeding supplies, a car seat, diapers, and a few clothes I think they would think I was absolutely out of my mind. The irony is that I think all the consumption actually tends to overcomplicate parenthood rather than “hack” it. 

Anyways, thanks for tuning in to my rant. It’s a daily battle to say “no thank you” to all the baby crap being thrown at us as hand-me-downs or well intended gifts to “make our lives easier.” 

Edit: Very cool to see all the validation on this topic!! Someone commented that this would be a cool documentary and I couldn’t agree more. It feels good to share this perspective with others, especially since my family thinks I’m some kind of radical earth humper and not just a mom with limited money/space/mental capacity to manage a house full of stuff. 

One thing to clarify though — parenting in western cultures and societies (I’m in the USA) is HARD. Having an economy and social system that doesn’t value the collective is HARD. If that sound machine and baby swing saved your life in the newborn phase, then it was *essential* and this post is not intended to make anyone feel bad about what they needed at that time. 

While I’m critical of the endless marketing, advertising, and manufacturing within the baby industry I am NOT critical of new moms and dads just trying their best to get by. With that in mind, my best advice to anyone expecting a baby is to keep it simple. Follow your baby’s lead and spend those late-night feeding sessions scrolling FB marketplace instead of Amazon ;) I’m on your side!

1ej9lph,Jaeger-the-great,1722707752,I dropped my phone and cracked the screen. To repair the screen would cost more than getting a new phone ,"The phone works perfectly fine otherwise and isn't that old. It's a Google pixel 4, which is definitely and older model but I never found any issues with it being outdated or any performance issues. 

But the screen is so cracked to the point that idk if it's worth keeping. I looked it up and it costs $250 to repair the screen. The phone itself costs me $200 when I purchased it. I can get a Google pixel 6 for $180. 

I hate that this is really making me weigh getting a new phone when aside from a cracked screen, this one works perfectly fine. I had taken the protector off a few days ago after it cut my fingers from the cracks and was going to add a replacement protector but I didn't realize I had run out of them.

I hate how expensive repairing these things is meant to be and how hard it is to repair modern electronic devices.

Chances are I will wait until my next paycheck to make my decision as that would set me back nearly $200, and I don't wanna do it on a whim, but it's gonna suck as there is loose glass bits on the screen. I feel like such a fool for not having a screen protector on my phone. Previously I had a phone where I cracked the camera lens and it was only $40 for the repair so I was shocked by this price. I'm not sure if there are alternatives other than likely purchasing a new phone and finding a way to recycle this one.

1eh77ml,Ill_Variation_2480,1722484483,What's your opinion on the polarizing Tiktok 'Underconsumption Core' trend?,"Okay, so I've seen many 'underconsumption-core' tiktoks recently where people will post their small makeup collections, old hair tools, clothes, etc that they have had + used for years. When I first saw this (early on in the trend), I understood why they said 'underconsumption' when referring to their actions; yet I see MANY people commenting ""this isn't underconsumption it's literally just using your stuff!"", or I'll see video essays talking about it saying it's not *really* underconsumption because they still have, say, 3 blushes in their makeup bag instead of one.

My take on this is that, yes, it IS people just using their belongings fully, but it also IS underconsumption because it is a radical rejection of the rampant overconsumption that we see online and in society overall. Sustainability and underconsumption, or even anticonsumption, rely heavily upon using what you already have, and people are always at different points in their conscious consumerism journeys. Criticizing someone for having those 3 blushes in their collection isn't necessarily helping to encourage underconsumption.

1ehr477,AngeliqueRuss,1722544606,Consumerism vs. Autonomy -- A Parable,"n a distant land, there were two villages, each with its own way of life. In the village of Consuma, the people lived under the rule of a wealthy lord. The lord provided them with basic necessities in exchange for their labor. He also introduced a market where villagers could buy exotic goods. The villagers spent their earnings on these goods, returning much of their wages to the lord, who grew richer with every transaction.

The villagers worked hard, tending fields and fighting battles when called upon. They believed that by buying these goods, they were improving their lives. But over time, they noticed that no matter how hard they worked or how much they bought, their situation never improved. The lord’s wealth increased while theirs dwindled.

In contrast, the village of Autonomia valued independence and self-reliance. The villagers here worked together to meet their needs, growing their own food and making their own clothes. They traded among themselves and avoided unnecessary purchases. Their wealth was modest, but it was shared among all.

One day, a traveler visited both villages. In Consuma, he saw people busy buying and selling, but their faces were weary and their spirits low. In Autonomia, he found contentment and cooperation, with people enjoying their work and supporting each other.

Curious, the traveler asked the people of Consuma why they chose to live this way. They explained that they trusted the lord to provide for them and believed that buying more goods would lead to better lives. But the traveler pointed out that they were trapped in a cycle of labor and consumption that only benefited the lord.

When the traveler shared his observations with the people of Autonomia, they smiled and said, “We prefer to rely on ourselves and each other. We have chosen a path of simplicity and independence, where our efforts benefit the whole community, not just one person.”

The traveler marveled at the wisdom of the villagers of Autonomia. He realized that true wealth comes not from the accumulation of goods but from the freedom to live a life of one’s choosing, free from exploitation.

And so, the traveler continued his journey, carrying with him the lesson that independence and cooperation bring true prosperity, while reliance on consumerism only deepens inequality.

1ehra67,awhafrightendem,1722545012,Musings,"This system is nothing but a complicated and elaborate reiteration of the feudal model. Consumerism is but a necessary evil (from the controllers' perspective) that forms the foundation of it.

The feudal model was simple, brutish and obvious. Monarchs, the sycophants around them, their mercenaries, and the masses they claimed literal ownership over and oppressed and lived off of, taking as much and as often as they liked including lives... everyone knew what was what and who was who and that made it vulnerable. People don't tolerate being treated that way for long, especially with impunity. The first time that what we now call 'human rights' were officially acknowledged it wasn't the noble act of some ruler, it was because a monarch was put to the sword and either would acknowledge these rights to life and property, or be beheaded. FORCE.

Things had to be done more covertly. Socialization, compulsory education, a new commercial paradigm driven by the constant exchanging of currency which in the minds of observers justifies observed financial outcomes, and a monetary system by which you could eventually again take as much and as often as you like. But, this time taking unnoticed, from an ignorant (because you educated them) populace, without actually going into their pockets (or accounts). This facilitated a 24/7/365 wealth transfer the likes of which was not possible under a feudal model, where you would have to actually physically command all the wealth you hold. Rather than steal the currency just use fiscal and monetary policy to steal the buying power out of it and though they're holding (depending on the currency) hundreds, thousands even millions they're as good as broke. 

Then you continue creating more and more currency to weaken the value of the existing currency, withholding the newly created currency from the masses and downloading it to those who are rich already (e.g government contracts), convert the currency into the true assets of Creation and means of production, transferring the real wealth gradually until the controllers hold all the land (all resources are either in it, on it or around it) and the masses hold nothing but intrinsically useless currency units that the controllers determine the value (buying power) of, and are forced to look to their exploiters for survival. What will free the masses? FORCE.

THE QUESTION IS WHO TRULY WANTS TO BE FREE

The world will not simultaneously get fed up and throw off the yoke, walking hand in hand, singing, into some utopian 'next phase' *unless it was already prepared by someone, waiting for them to walk into*. It's tougher on the outside. The livestock all think that they will die out there. There is much more to learn, do, and think about. The ones who built the system don't want the slaves getting ideas (or even knowing that there is life outside) and will go to great lengths to stop you. Government won't be your friend. People inside are taught to be lazy and opt for whatever is easiest. The ones you worry about freeing would rather betray the ones who want to shut down the plantation than give up their 'free three hots and a cot'.

1ehjk7r,Tuism,1722526223,DIY resoling these old crocs I really like,"Hello!

I have this pair of old crocs that I really like, and I want to resole them. I've found these old pumas slippers and I've taken the sole from that (they've hardly worn since I hardly wore them, the faux leather fell apart because it was just a shit material). Now I want to attach them to the crocs. Some questions:

1) Which glue? I've read up and seems like a lot of people say Shoe Goo and E6000. I can get [E6000 locally](https://www.createalittlemagic.co.za/products/e6000-glue-clear?variant=37767667024056) (I live in South Africa) but it dries clear and I was wondering if there were different varieties of E6000 and some were less suitable for shoes?

2) I see there are gaps in these soles, should I fill them with something before gluing so there is more contact surface to glue? What can/should I fill them with?

3) Should I cut the sole across ways at the widest part so that it would bend with the bending of the shoe to not stress the attachment unnecessarily? I will probably end up cutting the heel part anyway because these soles are a little shorter than the base of these shoes.

I’m finding quite difficult to change my mindset and consume less with some relatives who live a life totally focused on buying and appearances. For example, this weekend was my cousin’s 25th birthday and her mother and brothers got her TWENTY FIVE GIFTS. This is just an example of the crazy things i’m seeing around my family and also around friends and society as a whole.

Also, the whole phone upgrade cycle just seems absurd to me. My phone is completing 3 years now and i have been asked if i’m going to upgrade soon (it’s an iphone 11, is doing just fine). Some people are buying the latest phones with features they don’t even know how to use, just to show off. I’m planning to stay with mine until it gets bad. 

I feel like society has just gotten insane. The consumption is absurd and the mental health of these people is getting worse and worse, and they seem to not understand the relation between focusing solely on buying and their health decline.

Anyways, just ranting a bit because sometimes is too much to not share with people with the same mindset. Maybe someone has similar stories to share or situations where they feel shit is going insane.

The people in the corporation are consumers themselves, who work for the corporation to sustain their own consumerist behaviors.

It was obviously be a little more in depth than the 20 minute video, but it was down right depressing. The work she has done with Greenpeace and other environmental justice organization, has been phenomenal. 

As someone from the US, it is embarrassing how much we pollute other, poorer, countries. I knew it was a problem, but not on the scale that it truly is. I have already tried to reduce my family's consumption, but this book has convinced me to do more. Mainly, to get involved, in the ways I can, to push corporations to change also. 

As Consumers, I believe, the best thing we can do is vote with our dollars. I grew up in a farming family and know the damage corporate farms can do, so the main effort my family has been putting in lately is to cut down on our reliance on these dangerous farming practices, and helping others learn how to grow or harvest their own food too. 

I have changed to buying locally, pasture raised, organic meat (and consuming less meat overall), And am working up towards growing all my own fruits and veggies, through a large garden, berry patch and orchard. (Although the berries and orchard are still too young to grow substantial fruit.) Between growing our own food, hunting, and foraging, we have cut our reliance on the grocery store by almost half. And this has only been over the last few years. I hope to be full self sustaining with food in another couple of years.

This book has encouraged me to cut down on my screen consumption and live more consciously overall. Social Media, TV, and websites are all littered with ads, and I have fallen for those crappy products on social media ads before. I figure if I don't know about it, I won't want to buy it. 

I have a full time job and five kids, so it's harder to get out and be involved in protests and boots on the ground environmentalism, but once the kids are out of the house, I would like to focus more on this. 

What are some other ways you all have drastically reduced your consumption of different goods? My main focus has been reducing our consumption of terribly raised foods, and single use paper and plastic products. I would love to hear what others have done.

1eah5c6,Glorfon,1721764081,"Surely with 800,000 members some of have the means to fight consumerism with community organizing","I organize the Kansas City Really Really Free Market. It is a community event in which people donate things they no longer want or are otherwise willing to give away for free. Guests are welcome to take anything from the market totally for free. There is not even any quid pro quo exchange or any requirement to donate in order to take. I often summarize it as a community garage sale with no prices. I have been organizing this for seven years. It use to be once a month but this year we are doing three events per month traveling around the city.

If I can organize this in my spare time on a teacher's salary while still having time for other activism, surely there are many members of this subreddit who have organized or could organize something similar. Even if only 1% of this sub has the time, and means to start a project that would still mean 8,000 new anticonsumption community projects popping up in the next year. That'd be amzing! That's why I've decided to post synopses of 4 types of community projects that could help a city or county fight consumerism. I can't do all of these at once so I hope to inspire more people.

**Really Really Free Market**

Obviously, this is my preference. The requirements for start up are very low. I started with a handful of fliers, two tubs of my old things, and public park. It has grown consistently. The collection ebbs and flows but most of the time my concern is too many donations not too few. Whenever things are seeming low, I just start promoting the option to donate a little more and I get flooded with items. In 2019, we had two monthly events but the one at a record store stopped throughout the pandemic. This year we are back to expanding and now have a team of volunteers and 3 monthly events.

If you wanted to start your own, you would need a vehicle for transport, and enough space for storage between events. It would be difficult if you live in an apartment. However, if you ask around you may find another group that has space to help you out. I've had offers from a bike shop, indoor skate park, and book store. I'd recommend that you start with a group of at least 2 people so that there is some redundancy if someone is sick or a car is in the shop.
	Those are minimum requirements, but if you have opportunities to grow, you could do so much more. Now that I have a bigger team some people do repairs and skillshares. We bring multiple carloads of supplies each month. I'd like to get someone to manage our web presence as well. I've even toured two free stores in small towns. They had permanent store fronts and were open several days a week. Like a thrift store with no prices. That is a much better community resource than what I am doing. If you had the space money or support to do that, go for it.

**Community Repair Café**

Repair and reuse. A community repair café would be a place with tools and skilled volunteers who could help keep damaged things going. My city has two projects like this. One is a group that meets at  libraries with sewing supplies and offers free repairs. The other is a bike collective that has a shop open twice a week where they do free bike repairs.

Like the really really free market you could scale according to the resources and support that you have. You could also focus on certain items, an electronics repair café, a bike repair café, a book rebinding café, clothing, furniture, vehicles, sock darning, etc.. If you had enough volunteers with different skills you might branch into multiple locations or timeslots for different specialties.

You may not need a permanent location to begin. You could hold weekly or monthly events at schools, libraries, and churches. You'll need volunteers who have the relevant skills. If you have volunteers who know how to do repairs they probably have the equipment too. Otherwise repair equipment and consumables will be part of the start up cost.

**Libraries of Things**

This proposal, I admit, is a bit more demanding in terms of time, space, and labor. However, it also has a much larger impact. Libraries of things operate like a normal media library but people are able to check out items that they might occasionally need but do not always need to have on hand. When you need a ladder, you really need it, but most of the time it stays in the garage. With libraries of things people cans save money on items like ladders, save space in their homes, and a community would need fewer ladders overall. My city has a seed library and garden tool library. Board games, tools, kitchen tools, and kids toys would be my top priorities. However, you could get more specific or more adventurous. Perhaps holiday décor, prom dresses, or educational tools for a homeschooling coop. A friend of mine suggested an instrument library. The potential to specialize means that any city could support multiple libraries of things.

You'd need a dedicated space, at the very least a shed. Perhaps your local library would support this or another community group might have space to let you use. You'll also need quite a bit of volunteer help. A library isn't very useful if people have to plan ahead because they can only check out items the second tuesday of each month between 1:30 PM and 3. At a minimum, I think at least availability one a week would be necessary but the more time the better. I think a team of 5 to 10 librarians would be a good start. And of course, you need to fill it. Depending on the theme of the library the cost will be different. A good starting supply could start just by asking for in kind donations. If 100 neighbors were to gather up all their odd and seldom used kitchen tools they'd be making space in their kitchens and creating a significant collection for the community. Beyond that it may be necessary to run a fundraiser like kickstarter to get items for your library.

**Guerilla Gardens**

I'm also involved in a local guerilla garden. We've been working on a ½ acre vacant lot owned by the city for 3 years. We're even starting to put in permanent structures like a pergola and tool shed. All of this has been done without any permission or even contact with city government. Guerilla community gardens obviously are not going to make anyone food independent or even replace a large chunk of the neighborhoods groceries. However, they are still valuable. They can supplement the neighborhood's food supply with fresh local produce. They can beautify vacant lots. They can bring neighbors together and give people an nonconsumer hobby.

Site selection is key.  You need a big space that your neighbors can access but that the city doesn't care about. You can use an online parcel viewer to research the ownership and history of vacant lots. You can get mulch dropped off for free. The most costly aspect for us has been soil. Most urban areas have soil with high lead levels. Get yours tested. Some plants, like fruit trees tend to not take up lead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1eah5c6/surely_with_800000_members_some_of_have_the_means/,178,0.96,25,anticonsumption,/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1eah5c6/surely_with_800000_members_some_of_have_the_means/,Activism/Protest,,False,False,False,True,False,False,1728137566,

I work at a large national chain grocery store that is more ~sustainable~ and seemingly eco friendly compared to other chains.

I get dozens of customers every hour asking for these bags again and again and being genuinely sad and dejected when I say that they're not in at the moment, but we still have our free paper bags and reusable produce bags available.
Then we 'finally' got the produce bags back in, and I've noticed so many of them ripped off the roll and dropped around the store, or left behind in shopping baskets (therefore not serving their purpose at all). I've noticed a phenomenon of customers using these bags to bag already plastic-packaged meat and dairy products....why.

With that out of the way, here’s the question: 

While I browse for something I want to buy there are innumerable brands and options. Mind numbing as compared to 20 years ago. Online and offline- the stores are filled. Hundreds if not thousands of results on those apps.

I know the ‘pie’ is big but I often think if there are even takers for that much production. 

I even think to myself when I watch videos from factories of their machines producing things at an unbelievable speed. I’m like - who is buying all this? 

Are there that many people? Is there really that much demand? 

Edit- Just to add, I’m not referring to demand eventually created through marketing. That’s part of the system and the business.

1e8fzec,Maginaghat997,1721543418,Why I Avoid E-Commerce Sales and Discounts,"
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my thoughts on something that I've been thinking about a lot lately: e-commerce sales and discounts. We're all bombarded with flashy ads and tempting offers, especially during major sales events. But I've come to realize that making purchases based on my own needs, rather than when retailers want me to buy, is a game-changer. Here's why.

A while back, I used to get really excited about sales. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Prime Day—you name it, I was there, ready to snag the best deals. But over time, I noticed a pattern. I'd often end up buying things I didn't really need, just because they were on sale. Those 50% off tags and limited-time offers were so convincing that I felt like I'd miss out if I didn't buy something.

One day, I took a step back and asked myself: ""Am I buying this because I need it, or because it's on sale?"" More often than not, the answer was the latter. That's when it hit me. Sales and discounts are designed to create a sense of urgency and make us spend more. It's a push model where retailers are pushing their products onto us, making us think we're getting a great deal, when in reality, we're just spending money unnecessarily.

So, I decided to switch my approach. Instead of letting sales dictate my purchases, I started focusing on what I actually needed. If I needed something, I'd buy it, regardless of whether it was on sale or not. This way, I was in control, and my purchases were based on genuine needs, not manufactured wants.

And you know what? It's been incredibly liberating. I've saved a lot of money by simply avoiding impulse buys. No more falling for gimmicks or traps. The biggest saving and discount I've given myself is staying away from unnecessary sales altogether.

Next time you're tempted by a sale, take a moment to ask yourself if you really need that item. Trust me, making purchases based on your own needs, not when others want you to buy, is the best way to shop smart and save money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1e8fzec/why_i_avoid_ecommerce_sales_and_discounts/,54,0.97,8,anticonsumption,/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1e8fzec/why_i_avoid_ecommerce_sales_and_discounts/,Psychological ,,False,False,False,True,False,False,1728137566,

Because I am sick of it. I will not stop, but my life is way less fun because of it.

I was proud that I could say: I have not bought new clothes for 3 years now. But now, I cannot claim this anymore, because my mother, and other family members, force me to buy things, or give me presents even though I said, I don't want it. I don't need it.

Today my mother walked in a bathing suit store. She suggested me one and insistes I try it. Half-heartedly I tried it and said I didn't like it, which was true. (I almost never lie). She kept pushinh with the sales person and the entire family about
me chosing one, even though I already have everything a bathsuit and a bikini. I saw some bath shorts, and that was actually something I wanted to buy for a long time, but reckoned I did not really needed it. So feeling under pressure to buy something, I asked for something I actually wanted. My mother thinks it looks ugly and tries to discourage me, then changes her mind and wants to buy TWO. I don't need TWO bathing shorts. I hatdly need one, I only feel more comfortable with one. we started arguing, because she only ever wants things to go HER way even though it should be a present for ME.

The worse was the sale person claiming that my engagement went too far and my cousins starting whispering. It already happend once on this vacation. Like why do people except you to be all smiling when they already know you would not like their present.

Before I go ahead, I would really suggest that you only read this post ahead only if you feel you can handle what might be coming next,

and now let me be clear, by gross I dont mean stuff like corn , cause with corn , you still have safety that it wont randomly show up on your insta or on your google 

what I literally mean by extremely gross is...>!deformed human faces , which makes you wanna puke by just seeing of such things, !<I wont go into much details of it , just to save you guys from some trauma 

but eitherway , if it was a single incident, I wont be writing this post right now, but now I am at a point , where I have seen multiple instances of it at different platforms and it literally makes me wish there was SOME REGULATION to monitor such pathetic gross ads and content over internet,

I still remember like a few months ago , I opened my insta after like 3-4 months and sat down to maybe scroll some reels , but after 3-4 months , my reels algorithm was COMPLETELY F\*cked up , It was showing me random gross pics of people which I wish I could remove from my brain

and similar incident happened right now , I was just studying and googling answer to a maths question , and idk if you know about this site ""brainly"" where they used to be very good site during covid times , but post covid their enshitification started and they started to force us to see ads to get answers, which is okay , I was ready to watch ads sometimes , but now they are literally on a completely different level ,   
I literally had to see the worst n most gross image of my entire life and at that moment I just forgot about my maths question and closed the site immediately,   
I literally cant believe the extent these websites can go to just to make some crappy money

1e5m8tm,RWHock2,1721233000,Earth's Sweet Spot Is Long Gone,"This post is a self-therapy lament from an old guy who feels the Earth has missed it's sweet spot. That spot where one could live a simple but nice life. When I was a young boy the Earth's population was 2.5 billion. There were still far away places with strange sounding names...mystery was still out there to be explored. I grew up on a self sustaining ranch in the wilds of Oregon on the Snake River where there was almost no consumerism and relentless hard work. But it was tremendously enjoyable.

Now I live in a sea of ""stuff"" with 8 billion other people and it all requires extracting from the Earth. I make nice wood toys for my grandchildren (some quite elaborate), but they prefer the colorful, noisy plastic toys from China. My daughter-in-laws post numerous photos each day that are stored for all eternity on energy consuming servers. There are so many options to watch ""stuff"" but most of it is low quality pop culture. Same with much of the music...it all sounds very similar, trying to hit the magic mark and make it up the charts. Take off your clothes and see if that boosts your ratings (that started in the 60's).

I now live in a era of quantity over quality. I'm thinking that maybe you have to live 78 years in order to understand the breathtaking changes our world has experienced. Most people are like the frog in the slowly boiling pot, there is no  perspective to alert one's since of danger. There are many younger people who are also feeling this sense of loss, but most humans are oblivious to it. The trends are all in the wrong direction...we missed our sweet spot. However, eventually Mom Nature will call a halt to those trends.
