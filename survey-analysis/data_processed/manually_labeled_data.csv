I'm looking for a new pair of boots for the winter.

,Alright, so I'm wanting to begin saving up money for emergencies or if I need to make a large purchase in the future. I want to open a saving account but I know very little about them. I know the higher APY% the better, and I know I don't want one with fees. I pull $200 from my pay checks monthly and move it into a savings section of my card wich only has 0.02% APY. Does anybody have suggestions on a saving account that would be good for this? 

Second part, I have been trying to find a credit card with a good cash back rate on regular purchases like gas, groceries, and another one (or one for both functions in a perfect situation) that has a good cash back % for general spending, which would be bills for me. My current card Iam using gets 1.25% back. Essentially I'll just be to filter money through these cards to get cash back, which brings up another question, how long does a charge have to stay on a credit card before being paid off to actually receive the cash back for that transaction.

Even after I bought it, I still bike commuted.  Now, I have a 36 mile round trip drive which is not very pleasant to do with a heavy clutch and 35mph average.

I have been cruising around craigslist looking for beaters ($1500-3000) range and found a 92 miata for $1200.  Mechanically, its in pretty good shape. There are a few small fixes it needs, such as a burned out tail lamp bulb, new blinker relay switch, and a new rear window.  Otherwise it runs fine and pulls hard. I estimate i'd spend about $2-300 fixing all the small stuff on it and about $250 to register. So i'm still on the low end of my budget

Is this really a smart purchase? My other option is to either invest the cash I set aside for it, or use it for our trip this summer.


Edit: I am a mechanic, so working on cars is not a big deal for me, for what its worth.

I currently use 60-watt incandescents pretty much everywhere in my house, but the ones that are on most of the time are my three porch lights, two hallway lights, and the lamp in my livingroom.

The math works out like this:

I estimate these lights are on an average of 16 hours per day (high, I know). This comes out to 480 hours per light per month (average of 30 days per month). With each bulb using 60 watts, that comes out to 28.8 kilowatts used by each bulb each month. In total, 172.8 kilowatts is used to power all six bulbs each month. At $0.10 per kilowatt (my current electricity rate), this means the bulbs are costing me a total of $17.28 per month.

Now, break that down into simple terms:

* 16(hours per day)*365/12(days in month)=486.67(hr/mo)

* 486.67*60(wattage of bulbs)=29200(combined watts)

* 29.2(combined watts converted to kilowatts)*0.1(what my utility company charges per kilowatt)=2.88(cost of one bulb per month)=2.92

* 2.92*6(total number of bulbs)=17.52(total cost per month)

Since fifteen 4-watt bulbs equal one 60-watt bulb, divide the total cost by 15 to get the total cost per month of the LED bulbs: $1.17

If my math checks out, I can expect to save ~$16.35 per month on my electricity bill. At $7.72 per LED bulb, I will earn back the money I spent on them after three months.

I think that the prices are reasonable enough now that it is a good idea to make the switch. I actually plan on switching out the rest of my lights, but I figured I'd do the ones I use the most first and see how it works.

It is a scam.

The recurring cost of cell phone data plans lead me to shop for a plan that met my needs at the best price possible. I found Sprint’s Unlimited Freedom Plan which claimed to offer all the features of Unlimited Basic Plus, for less than $5/month after bill credits. I verified the features of the plan with 4 Sprint representatives, who assured me the plan would include 50GB/month of mobile hotspot and would essentially become free after purchasing a $13 SIM card and 2 months of $60/month payments before a credit would be applied to my monthly bill.

What I received is a plan costing $30/month, which does not include a mobile hotspot. I am now told it will cost $75/month to add a mobile hotspot to my plan.

Sprint customer service was unable to help me. I am told the plan I was sold does not exist. Feel free to Google search “Sprint free unlimited plan.” It will advertise the Sprint Unlimited Freedom plan as $0/month until April 2020.

But how durable are they over the long haul for normal use? (i.e. Wearing one pair every day for months on end. Desk jockey work and 2-3 visits to the gym per week?) 

Have any of you worn a single pair of Zenni-made glasses for 6+ months without an issue? 

Are the 6.95 plastic frames any less durable than the $15-$30 frames? Does the metal hold up over the long haul better than the plastic?

I assume that if Zenni is shipping 7,000 pairs of spectacles a day, the 3 bad reviews you find are the exception, not the rule, and people with negative experiences will go online a LOT faster. But they ARE out there - ""My plastic frames broke for no good reason when I put them on this morning."" 

EDIT 2: Actually, the internet could almost be like working tech support in a call center. One of my bosses once told me ""After six months here, you will probably think we sell the worst-designed, buggiest piece of !@#$ ever, and you will wonder how we make money if it sucks so hard. Just keep in mind, we get 10,000 calls a day. There are 50 MILLION units out there.""

If it matters, the three frames that I'm considering for daily use are these:

125415 - 6.95 - Translucent plastic

125116 - 6.95 - Black plastic with blue inner plastic

411512 - 6.95 - The basic semi-rectangular stainless steel frames

EDIT 1: I'm asking because I'm getting ready to ""feature up"" and get the $19 photochromic lenses with the $9 hydrophobic coating. It's ""only"" $40 with shipping, but still...that's for one pair, and I want to make sure they'll hold together enough to enjoy them. I already have nine pairs of ""practice"" pairs from Zenni that can serve as backups. :)

EDIT 3: Okay, thanks for all the feedback guys. What I'm taking away from this:

- Generally, these things can last anywhere from 6 months to 6 years, but just in case it's six months, order an extra pair. 

- Price has little effect on durability, so order an extra pair.

- Metal frames are usually the most durable, but an extra pair helps.

- Plastic can last pretty long too, except for the occasional pair that goes a bit early, so order an extra pair.

- Frames are not dog-proof, child-proof, etc. So order an extra pair.

- Go full-frame, never half-frame.",,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,,,self,,,How long do Zenni frames last?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/5700fo/how_long_do_zenni_frames_last/,,t3_5700fo,39,1.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,1.0,

This switch goes to a single outlet in the master bathroom. I have been living there for a couple months before the landlord was willing to get around to it.  I have had to buy a couple lamps because of the broken switch.

I was young and buying my first car, so I wanted something that would be MINE.  At first the $300 a month bill was easy-peasy, but then I lost my job, had to relocate and got a lower paying job.  I just made my last payment a few months ago, but I could have saved 5 years of headache and worries (and probably $10,000) if I bought a reasonable used car.  I know that buying a new car doesn&#39;t always have to be a mistake, but I assuredly didn&#39;t need to do that at that point in my life.</p>

<p>So how&#39;s about you?</p>

I seem can't understand where people getting money from!

Let me explain. I'm 40, and all my life I got a very good (I think so) salary and live a modest/frugal life. I do not buy expensive things, I do not blow my money in bars or restaurants. I buy used electronics and furniture, my car is 20 years old, and I do not have any loans or mortgages. I rent a tiny apartment. And I think I have a pretty good relationship with my money. And at the same time, where the hell do they all go?

I have a YNAB and I see where my money goes, but I cannot stop them go where they are going, cus they pay for my life.

And what is more mind-boggling is how people around me with less salary and with a bunch of children, managed to have expensive cars and new TV (I found mine in the trash, pretty happy about it), big houses (I guess it's a mortgage topic, we can skip?) and other stuff?

Do they actually have huge debts and struggle every day? Do they just have expensive cars and barely can afford the rent for next month? Or can't they just afford anything else and seat home every day until the next paycheck? Or do they actually have a bunch of money they know how to get? Side hustle? Do they cheat somewhere?

Almost all of them center around the theme of sacrifice or being miserable now for a potentially better future. I'm here to tell you, if that is how you are seeing it, you are doing it wrong. Of course, there is some component of delayed gratification, but it should never be at the cost of a happy present. I was going to do this as one long post, but it is turning out to be extremely long, so I'm going to divide this up into parts.

But how can you achieve both? Well, there is a made up word I like to use and it is called gamification. Basically it turns frugality into fun. There is another word that isn't made up called monetization. This is just finding a way to make money from the things you enjoy.

Lets start with something that isn't really either of those...which is optimization. This is possibly the easiest and doesn't require any fundamental change in your mindset. It does require a little forethought and planning, though. Probably the easiest place to achieve optimization is with your food budget. Are you in the habit of shopping at an expensive grocery store and buying only name brand products? Many people are. Sometimes because they think they are getting a healthier or better product. Many people also don't know that the generic or store branded products are made at the same places and from the exact same stuff as the expensive name brand foods. In most cases there is no secret recipe. So, low hanging fruit here is to simply buy generic. We can do better though. WHERE you shop is just as important as what you are buying.

This is going to have to be very general since every location in this country will have different options, but here is what you need to look for. Discount stores are almost everywhere, although the deals you'll find will vary by store. These are the Wal-Mart type stores. Maybe Trader Joe's fits into this, I don't have them in my area so can't say for certain. Aldi is another nationwide example if you have one near you. Maybe Target, but they seem to be high compared to other options in my area. Anyway, you get the point. These are not the boutique grocery stores. They are the basic option. They all have good generic option and store brands that are priced about half of the name brand stuff (sometimes less). Another great option for food is the Dollar Tree or similar dollar store. Not everything here will be cheaper, but some things are. Frozen fruit and veg here is always $1 a lb...usually cheaper than elsewhere unless there is a major sale on fresh or frozen someplace else. Lots of other bargains to be found throughout the store...just be sure you are checking the price per oz. to make sure it is an apples to apples comparison with other stores.

The final low hanging fruit when it comes to food is to find alternative sellers. Again, this is going to be a little different for everyone. But think outside the box. If you have flea markets that sell dent and ding or overstock groceries, these can be very cheap. How cheap? I often buy dry goods from these sellers at one of our local flea markets. Pinto beans are $1 for 2 lbs (I eat a lot of beans, lol), a 12 pack case of cereal is $7, I can get the fancy vegan snack bars for 6 for $1 (these retail for $1 or more each), I bought a bunch of fancy rice cake packages for 4 for a $1 (these retail for $3 per package)...I don't want to get bogged down in examples because what I eat and look for might be different than what you eat and would look for. Regardless of your eating habits, these places provide amazing bang for your buck. I know some cities have permanent stores set up for this type of thing, while others like mine just have these weekend flea market vendors. The point here isn't to get real specific, but it is to look for non traditional places to buy food at these huge discounts. I'm sure almost every region has something similar. Just think outside the box and ask around for info. Check craigslist or facebook for non traditional food vendors. I'm sure they are out there.

Once you have all these resources in your back pocket, develop your game plan. Figure out what you eat on a weekly or monthly basis and then figure out where you can get those items the cheapest. Be sure you aren't becoming frugal foolish. It doesn't make sense to drive 20 miles out of your way for 1 item that will save you 50 cents....but how does this look in practice? Well, I will give you my own example. I'm about 6'5"" and pretty athletic, so I eat around 3000 calories a day. I'm vegan, so I have those dietary restrictions to consider. I am roommates with a cat, so I have to feed her too. I rarely eat out, maybe a total of 4 times per month, so almost all meals need to be included in my grocery budget. My total grocery budget, which includes the cat and toiletries, etc is $100 a month. Some months I stock up on something and go over, some months I spend much less...but as a solid average it comes to $100 a month. I never feel like I'm neglecting myself, I never feel like I'm compromising on health, I eat a healthy diet I find extremely enjoyable. I'm not saying this is what everyone should spend. If there is healthy food you love you can't find cheap, by all means treat yourself! This is only intended to help those who might be struggling with their food budget to find some ways they can get it back into their control. Hope it helps! I'll be posting part 2 about monetization (I promise it won't be about food again) soon. Feel free to ask any questions! Please be respectful of others in the comments. We all eat differently, have differently family sizes, etc. So be sure you are trying to help others be frugal within their choices, not shame them for not making the same ones as you.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,public,,self,,,Thoughts on picking the low hanging fruit of frugality Part 1.

However, there is a difference between expensive hobbies, and a hobby which is about buying/researching things. For example, I love computers in general and gaming.  I have a nice computer and that expense is totally justified to me.  However, when the hobby turns into following the latest processor releases, watching loads of reviews of new parts on youtube, constantly browsing PC part deals, and playing the upgrade game - it turns into a hobby that is about buying computers, rather than a hobby about using them.  Similarly, I like cars and following the auto industry.  This is quickly turning into an obsession about a particular car which could turn into a totally unnecessary purchase.  I could say this about any of my more expensive hobbies - there is an undeniable joy in buying new things for your favorite hobby and putting them to use.  However, when the activity stops being about the activity and starts being about consuming more products, you risk turning frugal & fulfilling activities into basically just shopping.

I learned many valuable tips for shoppers and I would love to share them with you.

Coupons: 
Most stores will take expired coupons if they are the ones sent in the mail (the big, blue 20% off of one item coupon, the 20% off of your entire purchase coupon, the $5 off of $15 coupon or the $10 off of $30 coupon)
The online coupons will not be accepted if they are expired and have a UPC number that can only be scanned once so I wouldn't recommend printing out more than one. 
You can use multiple coupons per transaction. 
You can use one 20% coupon per item, for as many items you are purchasing.
You can bring in any old receipt with coupons to get an adjustment for up to a year later. (I have personally done adjustments for purchases over 2 years old. The transaction just needs, and will get, manager approval)

Price adjustments:
Any display item can be sold by an associate for up to 20% off, by senior managers for up to 30% off and by the store manager for up to 50% off. 
Any damaged item can be sold for up to 50% off. (Damaged can be anything from dents and scratches, to an item missing its packaging.
If a sign doesn't match the ticket price the lower price will be honored
and if the ticket price does not match the price at the register the lower price will be honored.
Any lower competitor advertised price on any item that is carried by the company as a whole will be matched,including items found online at bedbathandbeyond.com. To get an online price match you must have an associate order the item for you in the store. (Managers can also approve a shipping fee wave but mostly only do it if they might lose the sale. I would recommend making a small fuss about having to pay a shipping fee, that's usually all it takes)

Returns:
Bed Bath and Beyond has a lifetime guarantee on all of its items, if you bought it you can always return it, no questions. I do mean anything. For example: A woman brought back an iron because as she was ironing her shirt she ironed the plastic letters on the front of her shirt, melting the plastic on to her iron and ""damaging"" it. She got a new iron.
Receipts or the card you used to make the transaction can be used to make a return.
Nothing is needed to make an exchange or get store credit.
If you have purchased an item that BBB carries, even if you didn't purchase it from BBB, you can get store credit. ( I just wouldn't tell them you didn't get it from them. If you are not sure if BBB carries the item, check online)
If a part of an item brakes and is replaceable bring the broken part in and they will give you a new part. (The part it taken from a brand new item and given to you, the rest is sent back to the vendor.)

That is all I can think of right now, but I will answer any questions you all have. Hope this helps you save some money. = ]

Here’s the thing: the idea that you save money by not living in a city doesn’t always hold up. We bought a nice house and with a mortgage of around $1,600/mo, which sounds cheaper than living in New York, right? Wrong. Yes, our mortgage is cheaper than our rent. But we also have to pay $200/month insurance. $400/month taxes. $250/month gas. $150/month electricity. $120/month water. $200/month maintenance/repairs. So already, our expenses of $2920/month are more than what we were paying in Brooklyn. 

Not only that, but cars are expensive. Both of us need cars to get to our jobs. They’re both modest cars, but between $250/month in repayments, $100 in insurance, and $100 in gas, times it by two, and it’s another $1000/month, so we’re up to $4,000/month in baseline expenses for transport and housing, vs $2,800/month on Brooklyn (subway was only $100/month each and got is everywhere we needed). 

Not just that, but we’re finding that not living in a city takes up more of your time. Our house is modest, but even a simple 3 bedroom house takes a ton of upkeep. There’s no calling the super to come fix something, it’s all on you. Cleaning takes hours and hours a week vs 45 minutes in a smaller apartment. You also have to carve out time for exercise - in NYC you naturally walk at least an hour a day between the subway, walking to the store, etc, but now we have to find time in our day and give up personal time to keep fit. 

There’s also there’s opportunity costs not living in NYC. See some basement bargain flights to Europe for a cheap trip? They’re always out of NYC airport, certainly not out of rural PA. See an amazing job opportunity that can increase your income? Can’t just take an afternoon off and go to the interview, and there’s less jobs here to begin with. Want to get cheap tickets to a museum or a show? The only entertainment here is a cinema.

It’s also harder to find good food. My personal opinion has always been that spending reasonable money on healthier food is a good long term investment - what’s the point on skimping on lower quality food if it means you die of a heart attack at age 50? And it’s so much harder to find good quality food here, and already I can feel the effects on not eating quality food. 

So listen, I’m not saying our situation is typical. Everyone’s different, and you should live a lifestyle that works for what they want out of life (and I realize there’s plenty of cities that aren’t as walkable as NYC, so the savings in not having a car is negated). But just for our experience, don’t necessarily believe the idea that rural areas are a pathway to wealth simply because you don’t have to pay as much rent.

Edit: there’s been some really nasty comments here including some genuinely abusive PMS. I certainly wasn’t attacking anyone who chooses a different lifestyle! And there’s obviously tons of variables! All I was pointing out was that there’s a lot of costs with moving to a “LCOL” area - both money AND time wise - that can seem fringe but often add up to the point where it’s not always the clear cut equation that it seems, and these things aren’t always taken into account in these kinda subs, that’s all.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,In defense of HCOL areas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/12oplb5/in_defense_of_hcol_areas/,all_ads,t3_12oplb5,1858,0.8799999952316281,,,,0.0,,,0.0,1681680358.0,0.0,,,0.0,,[],,[],,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,3263881.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,0.0,6.0,,,#dadada,6aa28a70-4020-11eb-a539-0ed3949af309,,t2_fb8xo861,0.0,{'gid_2': 1},1.0,0.0,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 500, 'coin_reward': 100, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': None, 'days_of_premium': 7, 'description': 'Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'icon_width': 512, 'id': 'gid_2', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Gold', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'static_icon_width': 512, 'sticky_duration_seconds': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",1.0,1.0,,0.0,[],,,[],0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,False,0.0,

It's for the most part a very dry heat with very little humidity. 

Little bit of setting: 

* My room is on the second floor of our town house.

* My rooms window faces the sun most of the day so it gets a lot of heat build up through the day. There are only regular plastic blinds on at the moment.

* This window also faces a loud highway. I sleep well through it at the moment but couldn't imagine doing so with the window opened so window mounted devices are a no go. 

* PC/Reddit station is in said room generating more heat. 

* Power bill through the winter was ~$55 and I'd like to keep it in that ball park through the summer/fall. 

Steps I've taken and plan on taking:

1. I figured it would be best to keep the heat out as much as possible, so I have just ordered [*This*](http://www.amazon.com/Gila-CS78-Control-Residential-36-Inch/dp/B000QD9R9Q/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) film/tint to block light/heat. I also plan on installing some curtains. Recommendations on some curtains you've had experience with?

2. Meal Prepping - I try to cook my work weeks meals on Sundays so that the oven and stove top aren't generating extra heat through the week.

3. Desk fan, it's helped through the spring but isn't going to cut it for much longer. I've seen tips for DIY fan mods with a pump and copper coils, but the comment sections to those posts say it isn't worth the hassle. Is that still the case?

Feel like I should say more but can't think of anything at the moment. 

Thank you guys in advanced.

We initially wanted a wedding on a small budget (as I can't justify spending 30K+ on one) but one thing we're noticing is all (wedding) photographers are REDICULOUSLY expensive. An avergae 8 hour session is running between $3500-$4000 and I just do not feel comfortable dropping that much for someone doing roughly half a day's work. I'm not sure if it's our location (Austin, TX) or why photographers in general are just that pricey. There are other people cheaper, but my fiancee is REALLY convinced that spending the $4K on someone will be worth it for quality photos (not saying she's wrong, but just think we can get the same quality for cheaper). I know people will say ""it's just the industry"" or ""it's your special day"" but I still think we can do better price wise. Ideally, something around 1/4th of that would be way better.

When going over ways that we think we should save some money, cable comes to mind for me.  I have tried to advocate for cable disconnection a few times in the past few years that we have had Netflix, and I want to make my point one last time in the best way possible before the subject is dismissed.  We do not argue over this difference of opinion, but my wife asked me last March to wait until March 2013 to revisit this discussion.  Next week is my chance to lay out my case of why we should no longer pay for cable!  So far I already have a spreadsheet analysis of money we would save and a few logical things to say to express my viewpoint.  

Some other things we have already done to save more money each month are switching my wife's Samsung Galaxy to Straight Talk, cutting my old cell out completely and replacing it with a $20 tracfone with minutes on it for emergencies if I am in an accident or need to call occasionally.  We have called our ISP and complained about our internet price and got a free upgrade to 50 download speed as a result.  We have Netflix and Amazon Student paid up til next year, we do not have Hulu at all.  We do have a Roku that I bought last year for the wife to see if that would be something that she would enjoy dropping the cable for , and she didn't like it as much as I hoped she would.

What are some other approaches that I could take to getting her on-board with cutting out the cable?  If this attempt doesn't get her on board the subject doesn't get brought up anymore.


*Edit - We do have some savings and the cable isn't making us go under or anything, we should actually have about 12k in the bank on the date that I am due to graduate.  So using me sharing that we're unemployed at the moment isn't in itself why we should cancel cable.  If money was tight then yes.  This is purely me hoping to have saved the extra major sum by the time we're into our older age.  I started college with zero debt, we do not have a house payment or car payment, and my student loans are not nearly as high as a lot of people that I go to college with right now.  I have cut out some of the wall of text that was previously here because some of it was poor communicaton on my part and some of it was people drawing inferences to things that were not true.  The only thing that someone has commented negatively that I think is relevant to our situaton is that, as I said in the original OP, I disagree with my wife wanting a television in the kids' room for sleepovers/occasional watching.  That said, she would be willing to remove the tv most likely anyway, and right now we do have parental controls and a timer on it.  It is mostly used by them <1 hour a day and sometimes on sleepovers.  The thing I was expressing frustration with is that my wife likes to turn the tv on while they are asleep for white noise (at low volume) and light.  I disagree with this and have of course bought night lights before.........................................Either way the tv will be removed from their room so let's move on to the relevant topic, which is ways to get her to be open-minded with cutting the cable!*

TL;DR - What are some ways to get a spouse on board with your strong belief in cable cutting?


**EDIT - Multiple people commented on using PlayOn with the Roku.  This is my most-liked solution and the one that I believe my wife would be the most likely to give a try.  The only problem is a few people chimed in that they didn't like it much and online reviews are pretty weak so may actually just try HTPC alongside cable first after all...**

EDIT - For alternative solution the first step I will try to get the wife to hopefully agree to use a makeshift HTPC (either one of our desktop computers or laptops) hooked up to the main tv 2-3 times per week just to see how she likes it.  If this goes ok and she is receptive I hope that she will then agree to unplug the cable completely for a week straight and use only the HTPC.  If this then goes ok I hope to cut our cable completely!

Alternative solution # 2 - Thanks for the suggestions! - If the HTPC transition does not go over well, I will likely explore Dish or DirecTV because as it is now we are paying $61/month (not including license fees, taxes, franchise fees, city fee, other fees) for around ~80 channels.  Right now we're paying ~$800/year for the slightly under 80 channels!

I'm a techy guy who has resisted getting a smartphone due to the expensive data plans.  My wife has an iphone with att and it really makes me sick that we pay $30 a month just for internet service on it.  

My cell phone is an add-on line for only $10 a month but I'm really wanting to get internet service on my line.  I looked into it and sure enough it's another $30 month for only 3GB.  I'm sure they'll be adding tax to this as well.

My brother-in-law was telling me about Boost Mobile and that he was paying $35 a month for unlimited internet and messaging.  This sounded like a good deal.  The BM plan started at $50 and then went down $5 every six months until it gets to $35. That sounded good to me and I even found a site where I could get a discount on the service bringing the cost down by a little and they don't charge tax.

I found a phone I liked on ebay for $50 cheaper than BM had listed on their site.  I did a little more looking and guess what?  BM raised their Android plan to $55 month with the lowest shrinkage being $40 month!  They did this in September of last year.

I really wish I weren't so tight with my money but I am having trouble with the notion that combined my wife and I would be paying over $60 a month just for Internet on our phones.  My wife uses wifi at home and work and I would be using wifi at home and at work.

Oh and while I'm complaining, we blocked texting on our phones.  We both agree that it is crazy for att to charge for texts we received.  We were paying $2-3 a month for texts we were getting from people.  She now uses Google Voice for free texting and I text her using the desktop GV app when I need to tell her something quick.

I&#39;m a techy guy who has resisted getting a smartphone due to the expensive data plans.  My wife has an iphone with att and it really makes me sick that we pay $30 a month just for internet service on it.  </p>

<p>My cell phone is an add-on line for only $10 a month but I&#39;m really wanting to get internet service on my line.  I looked into it and sure enough it&#39;s another $30 month for only 3GB.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be adding tax to this as well.</p>

<p>My brother-in-law was telling me about Boost Mobile and that he was paying $35 a month for unlimited internet and messaging.  This sounded like a good deal.  The BM plan started at $50 and then went down $5 every six months until it gets to $35. That sounded good to me and I even found a site where I could get a discount on the service bringing the cost down by a little and they don&#39;t charge tax.</p>

<p>I found a phone I liked on ebay for $50 cheaper than BM had listed on their site.  I did a little more looking and guess what?  BM raised their Android plan to $55 month with the lowest shrinkage being $40 month!  They did this in September of last year.</p>

<p>I really wish I weren&#39;t so tight with my money but I am having trouble with the notion that combined my wife and I would be paying over $60 a month just for Internet on our phones.  My wife uses wifi at home and work and I would be using wifi at home and at work.

The ultimate moral here is most food scrap seeds and fresh cuttings can be planted or cloned. In hindsight, I feel like that should be an obvious statement, but it's really not in the modern day. It kind of blew my mind how much of the stuff you buy at the grocery store can be planted for fun and profit when I first started to get into gardening. 

And just FYI, cloning plants is far more difficult with some plant species than internet articles describing how to clone them make out. Most internet articles act like you can clone anything if you just put a cutting in a cup of water. In practice, only some types of plants actually clone that way reliably. You kind of have to develop a technique for each. Biggest universal principle I've learned is that the area you want to take root should be kept in the dark as much as possible. That usually means putting some kind of collar (e.g. peat moss or rockwool) around the stem and putting it in an opaque and covered container with water so only the top half of the plant with the leaves gets light.

**Grocery store stuff I've grown plants from:**

1.	Pinto beans – Grown from a bag of dried Goya pinto beans. Just plant the beans like you would from a seed packet. They sprouted in a few days. I assume it would work with other varieties of bean, but pinto are the only ones I’ve tried.

2.	Basil – Can be cloned from fresh herb cuttings bought in the produce aisle. Clones quite easily in just a glass of water. I’ve had roots pop in a literally just two days with rooting hormone added (a virtually unlimited supply can be bought for about $5 on the internet), though it tends to vary a lot based on the quality of the cutting.

3.	Peppers – Seeds inside fresh peppers generally sprout as easily as garden store seeds. You might have less luck with green bell peppers and jalapenos since they’re picked when not ripe though. I’ve successfully grown habaneros, cherry peppers, sweet peppers, and long finger peppers from grocery store seeds.

4.	Mint – Can be cloned from cuttings. Try to use the less woody stems, as they’ll be more likely to root. I found mint moderately difficult to clone. I took 5 cuttings. 2 rooted, but only 1 survived. Once you have a healthy plant, it’s easy to transfer it to another container by burying the runners in the new container.

5.	Rosemary – Can be cloned from cuttings. Rosemary is pretty difficult to clone. I took 10 cuttings and only 1 survived. It took about 1-2 months to root too. I’d probably buy an aeroponic cloner if I was going to try clone more of this. You get better results when the part of the stem you’re trying to root is kept in the dark. I did this to an extent with rockwool collars, but it’s still a race for the plant to root before the leaves and stem start to rot.

6.	Blueberries – I’ve grown blueberry plants from frozen aisle blueberries. If you have fresh blueberries you’ll want to stratify the seeds by keeping them in the freezer for 60 days to simulate winter. You can skip this with frozen blueberries though. Keep in mind growing blueberries from seed takes a while. The plants are pretty easy to take care of once sprouted. Only real caveats are use acidic soil and keep it moist at all times. They’ll have to grow for about 2 years before they start producing berries, and they won’t get up to full rate production for 3-5 years.

7.	Garlic – You can plant whole cloves. Put them about an inch deep in the soil, skin on, pointy side up and water when soil is dry. They’ll sprout in a week or two under ideal conditions. You can harvest them after they’ve grown for about a month for “green garlic” which looks and is used like green onions, but has a more garlicky taste (though milder than regular garlic). You can also just let them grow into bulbs. If you do that you’ll want to plant them in the fall, let them go through winter and then harvest in the next summer.

8.	Green onions – The white ends can be planted if you leave the little root nubs on. I usually leave about an inch of the white part on what I’m cutting. The more white you leave the higher the chance of success and give you a more robust plant (though the success rate is very high regardless).

9.	Carrots – Carrot plants can be grown by planting the fat end of a carrot. Plant the flat side down and the round end up, with the round end sticking slightly out of the soil. I should note, while I’ve successfully grown carrot plants like this, I’ve never gotten a full-sized carrot from doing it. I presume it’s possible, but clones grown in this way don’t always have the same potential as growing from seed.

10.	Romaine lettuce ends – Put the end of the romaine head in a glass of water and new leaves will sprout up. Note that when you do this you’re never going to get a full head out of it (at least I never have) the way you would with seed. It’ll get about half-sized and then bolt. What I do is save the ends in the fridge until I have like 6 and then plant them all at once. When each have about 6-8 decent-sized leaves I’ll harvest them and combine into a single salad. The lettuce will taste sweeter than mature lettuce because it will all be young.

11.	Tomatoes – Seeds from store bought tomatoes can be grown. Keep in mind most store bought tomatoes are F1 hybrids (except heirloom tomatoes), so the seeds you plant might not produce tomatoes that look exactly like the ones you got the seeds from. I’ve heard the same is true of peppers, as well, though all the peppers I’ve ever grown from grocery store seeds end up looking just like their parents.

12.	Potatoes – Can be grown by letting eyes form on a potato and planting that. Cut the potato up so each chunk you plant has at least 3 eyes on it.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,public,,self,,,"I garden and cook a lot.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/CsDJO.jpg) is my new and improved approach to grocery shopping. At the time of my last post I thought I was doing so well with my grocery shopping, and I suppose I was doing a lot better than some people, but I've opened my eyes since then. I've switched from canned beans to dry, I buy a lot less convenience foods (like microwave popcorn. I just bought a huge bag of kernels for like $1 and still have a ton). I buy in bulk more often, buy only unprocessed vegetables (no more baby carrots), and I've become more flexible with what I buy. For instance, I think more like ""I need some sort of cheese"" or ""I need something like sour cream"" than get too specific. Then I can adapt more easily to sales and/or clearance items. 

I spent a total of $63.34 at three different grocery stores today and got an entire table full of food! By buying food on sale and on clearance, I saved a serious bundle. I even got to splurge and buy some good coffee and rather pricey low-calorie salad dressings that were on sale for $3 each. Without these splurges, my total would only have been $50.35! Along with some supplemented items from my pantry, this haul will last me for at least two weeks. I'll also be freezing some of the meat and vegetables for later use. So here's the breakdown: 

* $1.98 - 2 pounds of lentils 

* $0.99 - 1 pound dried black beans

* $1.98 - 6 lbs yellow onions

* $1.99 - 5 oz shredded parmesan

* $1.99 - 32 oz ricotta cheese

* $0.79 - 4-pack strawberry greek yogurt (<$0.20 each!)

* $0.25 - Plain greek yogurt cup

* $0.99 - Hillshire Farms Peppered Turkey breast

* $3.95 - 5 - 10 oz. packages Oscar Meyer turkey breast ($0.79 each)

* $0.89 - loaf of bakery wheat bread

* $2.50 - 2 dozen eggs

* $1.61 - 1 butternut squash

* $0.79 - 1 green bell pepper

* $0.83 - 1 yam

* $1.09 - 1 bunch celery

* $4.36 - 4.46 lbs gala apples

* $3.99 - 2 lbs grape tomatoes

* $1.25 - 1/2 gallon fat free milk

* $0.00 - Yoplait yogurt

* $1.32 - 2.63 lbs navel oranges

* $3.77 - 3.81 lbs assorted pears (bosc, red, bartlett)

* $3.07 - 3.88 lbs zucchini

* $2.05 - 2.47 lbs broccoli

* $1.49 - Kale bunch

* $4.00 - 4 red bell peppers

* $2.00 - organic cauliflower

* $1.49 - 10 lbs. russet potatoes (not pictured)

* $2.00 - 2 bags of baby spinach

* $6.00 - 2 light salad dressings (splurge!)

* $6.99 - Tully's coffee (splurge!)

<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/CsDJO.jpg"">Here</a> is my new and improved approach to grocery shopping. At the time of my last post I thought I was doing so well with my grocery shopping, and I suppose I was doing a lot better than some people, but I&#39;ve opened my eyes since then. I&#39;ve switched from canned beans to dry, I buy a lot less convenience foods (like microwave popcorn. I just bought a huge bag of kernels for like $1 and still have a ton). I buy in bulk more often, buy only unprocessed vegetables (no more baby carrots), and I&#39;ve become more flexible with what I buy. For instance, I think more like &quot;I need some sort of cheese&quot; or &quot;I need something like sour cream&quot; than get too specific. Then I can adapt more easily to sales and/or clearance items. </p>

<p>I spent a total of $63.34 at three different grocery stores today and got an entire table full of food! By buying food on sale and on clearance, I saved a serious bundle. I even got to splurge and buy some good coffee and rather pricey low-calorie salad dressings that were on sale for $3 each. Without these splurges, my total would only have been $50.35! Along with some supplemented items from my pantry, this haul will last me for at least two weeks. I&#39;ll also be freezing some of the meat and vegetables for later use. So here&#39;s the breakdown: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>$1.98 - 2 pounds of lentils </p></li>
<li><p>$0.99 - 1 pound dried black beans</p></li>
<li><p>$1.98 - 6 lbs yellow onions</p></li>
<li><p>$1.99 - 5 oz shredded parmesan</p></li>
<li><p>$1.99 - 32 oz ricotta cheese</p></li>
<li><p>$0.79 - 4-pack strawberry greek yogurt (<$0.20 each!)</p></li>
<li><p>$0.25 - Plain greek yogurt cup</p></li>
<li><p>$0.99 - Hillshire Farms Peppered Turkey breast</p></li>
<li><p>$3.95 - 5 - 10 oz. packages Oscar Meyer turkey breast ($0.79 each)</p></li>
<li><p>$0.89 - loaf of bakery wheat bread</p></li>
<li><p>$2.50 - 2 dozen eggs</p></li>
<li><p>$1.61 - 1 butternut squash</p></li>
<li><p>$0.79 - 1 green bell pepper</p></li>
<li><p>$0.83 - 1 yam</p></li>
<li><p>$1.09 - 1 bunch celery</p></li>
<li><p>$4.36 - 4.46 lbs gala apples</p></li>
<li><p>$3.99 - 2 lbs grape tomatoes</p></li>
<li><p>$1.25 - 1/2 gallon fat free milk</p></li>
<li><p>$0.00 - Yoplait yogurt</p></li>
<li><p>$1.32 - 2.63 lbs navel oranges</p></li>
<li><p>$3.77 - 3.81 lbs assorted pears (bosc, red, bartlett)</p></li>
<li><p>$3.07 - 3.88 lbs zucchini</p></li>
<li><p>$2.05 - 2.47 lbs broccoli</p></li>
<li><p>$1.49 - Kale bunch</p></li>
<li><p>$4.00 - 4 red bell peppers</p></li>
<li><p>$2.00 - organic cauliflower</p></li>
<li><p>$1.49 - 10 lbs. russet potatoes (not pictured)</p></li>
<li><p>$2.00 - 2 bags of baby spinach</p></li>
<li><p>$6.00 - 2 light salad dressings (splurge!)</p></li>
<li><p>$6.99 - Tully&#39;s coffee (splurge!)</p>

<hr/></li>
</ul>

<p>=$63.34</p>

<p>If anyone has more tips for me on what I could be doing differently, please let me know. I value this community because it helps this poor lady live a much better life. So lay it on me. </p>

I'm talking, 10 to 20 times cheaper?

Two things I think of immediately are:

* HDMI cables. If you go to a big box store they'll try to sell you a Monster cable that practically requires financing on its own, whereas places like [monoprice.com](http://www.monoprice.com) can be 10 to 20 times cheaper for their brand, which works just as well.

* Eyeglasses. I don't wear glasses since LASIK, but I remember it costing hundreds of dollars to get glasses and frames at a mall chain store, and every little enhancement to the lens added to the price. Nowadays it seems like there are dozens of places online (like [Zenni Optical](http://www.zennioptical.com/)) to get equivalent products for twenty bucks or even less.

What other types of products out there should I be buying online for prices that are a steal compared to brick and mortar shops?

<p>Two things I think of immediately are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HDMI cables. If you go to a big box store they&#39;ll try to sell you a Monster cable that practically requires financing on its own, whereas places like <a href=""http://www.monoprice.com"">monoprice.com</a> can be 10 to 20 times cheaper for their brand, which works just as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Eyeglasses. I don&#39;t wear glasses since LASIK, but I remember it costing hundreds of dollars to get glasses and frames at a mall chain store, and every little enhancement to the lens added to the price.

But it's driving me so crazy every day that I don't know what to do anymore.

Long story short - my mom is unemployed and has never held a job in her life. My abusive dad, who she married straight out of college, forbid her from ever having a job. Her degree here is also useless. STILL, she divorced my dad and gained freedom. I thought she would find herself a job by now. It's been 7 years, no job.

That's not the worst part. She also spends her money carelessly. Money she hasn't earned herself and this bothers me so much. The money she gets every month is from the government. Not welfare, but sort of a deal that was given to both my parents when we first moved to this first-world country as refugees. Am I wrong for being bothered by this? We are living beyond comfortably, in a condo that's too big for the 3 of us, and I feel so fucking guilty about it every day. So the more that she complains that we are ""poor"" or living ""like shit"" I get so angry. She doesn't realize how good we have it, yet she can't even manage the money she gets. She seems to think that it's none of my concern, because I have a job of my own and she's a single mother.

I understand that being a single-mother to two teenagers is HARD. I can't even imagine. But I thought that once I got my own job and started providing for myself and helping out around the house, things would get better. Wrong. She still spends so much money each week on Starbucks and shopping. She doesn't shop at high end stores or anything but she just shops more than necessary, and it only bothers me because she ALWAYS complains about not having enough money to pay the bills.

Instead of going out to department stores and buying ""this scarf that was on sale for $10-20!"" every other week or so, shouldn't she putting money aside for emergencies? To pay bills on time and pay off her credit card debt? Don't all those 'small' purchases add up in the end? 

I can't possibly be the only one to think this is a ridiculous way of living. It also bothers me because when I need something, I'm met with refusal and a lack of support. Like when my school loans don't come in on time and I need to pay an amount to my school, that she knows she will get back eventually, she makes me feel like complete shit for giving me that money and constantly nags me about it until I pay her back. WHICH I WAS GOING TO DO ANYWAY.

I just don't know what to do anymore... She buys EVERYTHING my 17 year old brother asks for, because he's an unemployed high school student, even if it's an expensive pair of shoes or video games, but when I ask for something, and I usually only ask for necessary things, she denies it and complains that she has no money.

Every time I confront her about it, it sparks a huge fight and she tells me to move out while knowing damn well I can't afford to move out even if I wanted to! 

Is there any way I can talk to her about these things reasonably? Am I being unreasonable? Please, I just don't know where else to seek help or insight. Maybe someone here has dealt with a similar situation?

*edit: thanks for all the replies, seriously!

Yes, I am aware of how close moissanite is.  I would greatly appreciate it if comments could be limited to the buying process of actual diamonds.*

We have all seen the same story:  Guy buys diamond ring for $10k.  Later on, guy decides to sell it for $5k.  Can't.  Tries to sell it for $2k.  Can't.  Pawn shop offers him $500, and that's being generous.  

So, how do I do this correctly?  All I really know is - retail stores will be a rip-off, and Craigslist has massive scam potential.   

In passing, a jeweler has told me ""select the diamond from a gemstone wholesaler, and then commission a custom setting"" - and that was the extent of the conversation.  Is this a viable plan?  Is this a negotiable process - and if so, what are the negotiation customs for that industry?  I've heard NYC is the diamond capital, and I am about 3 hours away - is it worth going there?

What are my best options for financing?  Yes - I am fully aware of reasons why I *shouldn't* finance luxury goods.  In my particular circumstance, the savings accrued via expediting this entire process will outshadow any finance charges.  Still looking for the smartest way of doing this.

A lot of people suggested going slow, a lot suggested going cold turkey, some people suggested staples and some just said to start out with prepared freezer meals, and one or two people informed me I eat out too much (lol, I know). To anyone who also spent some time giving meal/recipe ideas, thank you! I will try make use of them.

I think I am going to try using the top commentor's suggestion of making a habit of getting my food from the grocery store (already I wanted to get take out today, but chose to stop at the store on the way home instead--baby steps).

I have a problem with my mindset about carrying credit cards on me, all the time. I have a feeling of safety when I carry a credit card with me, in case anything should happen or I would like to do something spontaneous. But it ends up costing me a small amount of money daily, because I always end up buying a coke or something like that.

Do you have a tip as to how I can keep my feeling of safety, without carrying a credit card or cash?

I think I lead a pretty frugal life as is since I eat most my meals at home, wash my clothes in my panda washer with spin dryer(water is free at my apartment complex), use reusable cloth menstrual pads, etc. I do have some luxuries like a car, cable, internet, and cell phone. I've been very good at living frugal as a single woman and I'm not sure how I will fare with a baby now.

I've already purchased the crib, stroller, and convertible car seat for when my baby is born. I'm asking for clothes for 3 months-5 years for my baby shower and my guests know that it can be used stuff since I don't need new baby clothes. My cousin is sewing me reusable cloth diapers and I plan to exclusively use cloth diapers. I do know for a fact that I won't be able to breastfeed my baby very long because of medications I'm going to need to start taking soon after I give birth. 

My expenses are listed below:

* $255 Rent
* $90 Electricity
* $35 Gas to cook
* $105 Cable and Internet (I'm a student and need internet, Cable is my entertainment since I rarely go out)
* $55 Cell Phone
* $195 Car insurance (Full coverage since my car is a 2014)
* $80 Gasoline
* $20 Car Fund( oil changes, etc)
* $100 Groceries
* $15 Dining Out
* $15 Hobbies( Mostly crafts, candle making stuff, etc)
* $40 Personal spending money
* $10 Pet Needs (Small dog and 7 fish)
* $20 Prescriptions
* $50 Medical Co Pays
* $20 Gift Fund( Birthdays, Christmas, Etc)

I've decided to get rid of cable tv, dining out, hobbies, gift fund, and I'm going to cut my gas and personal spending. I'm also going to try and cut back on my electric bill. I refuse to get rid of my car because I need reliable transportation in my area because public transportation is seriously lacking. My car also has 100,000 mile/10 year warranty and I don't have to worry about repairs for a while. I'm also not getting rid of my dog or fish since they bring me a lot of joy and comfort.

Any ideas on what I can do to reduce costs and somehow not end the month with $5 left over. 
Major things that I don't see changing:
- All of the home section 
- All of the Bills section minus at&t (looking into mint mobile, us mobile, invisible, or straight talk... just have to complete some research on costs and reliability of each provider)
- I would really like to keep my monthly savings at 300 (already drastically reduced how much is going into savings, which I'm not very happy about)
-Haircut is necessary due to military (I am not going to shave my own head anymore. Done it for years and finally decided to grow it out)
- Credit card payments should zero out within a few weeks to a month or two

I'm not bringing a plus one and when I went on their wedding website, they do not have a registry listed.

Instead of giving them something they may not want or use, I'm thinking of giving cash. However I'm lost at how much I should give.

I don't want to seem cheap. But unfortunately I have a fairly tight budget. I don't make a whole lot of money, though due to my job there seems to be a few of my friends who feel I am rich. I currently live with my parents (I pay them rent) and am trying to pay down my debt and get ahead a little financially. 

The wedding is small, but I'm not sure how many people are invited. But the venue is small, so I don't think a lot of people have been invited. I'm not in the wedding party either. 

I was thinking of giving between $50 and $75. I would love to give more but I know I just can't afford it right now :(

I know typically the rule is to cover your meal. But I have no idea what type of meal they are going to be serving. 

I'm curious to hear what everyone else has to say.

My haircut is pretty simple, just the typical short sides with the clippers and long top with scissors, and paying loads of cash for a simple cut is not very appealing. I know getting all the tools and such would probably require a $50 investment, but is it worth it? Has anyone had success with cutting their on hair? I'm a chemist who doesn't see the light of day much if it goes bad haha! Any advice would be awesome!

TL;DR Should I cut my own hair to save money? How hard is it?

So, frugal parents of Reddit, without sacrificing safety and quality, what are some baby things that I really need in the first year as a first-time parent? And what are some frugal substitutes for items that are advertised as ""must-haves""?

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL for your answers! I am still going through them all, I may not reply to everyone but I promise I'm reading every single one of them. I've learned a lot about basic needs off the bat, along with ideas that can be implemented based on what my baby is like. I will definitely be buying a new car seat, that's for sure! And I will be a regular at consignment shops for a good long time.

I know everyone has different parenting styles, so thank you for coming together to be kind to this new mama and for giving me your honest opinions. Cheers!

But nearly every video is giving the same advice to save money : stop going to restaurants/eating out 5 times a weak, stop getting coffee at Starbucks every day, reduce shopping new clothes, stop going to the movies and buying popcorn, stop having weekly manicures, and so on.

I mean is this even a thing ? Who eats out 5 times a week (or even one), who gets Starbucks every morning and who is still going to the movies with this economy ?

I'm so fed up trying to find tips and getting this ""who lives like this ?"" advice. I get that some people are rich and can afford it, and a few people get in debt because they have a problem with spending/cooking/beauty/idk. But all this inspirationnal ""I saved up for a house by not eating out anymore !"" is just so scandalous ! They need a reality check so bad.

Please try new things! There's a lot of good tips here on where to start and how to keep going, even. This *is* a reminder to accurately value all of your resources, though. 

First and foremost, this post isn't addressing everyone in the group. Feel free to chime into the discussion even if you don't feel like it applies to you, every voice belongs here.

But some you either don't assign a value to the skills you have and the time it takes to do a repair or make something new and it colors your opinion of what frugal is. Or you forget how much your tools cost. Or you're so used to your skillset (or you learned some skills so young) that you've forgotten how much time and effort went into acquiring those skills.

You are able to go to a wholesaler and get raw materials and turn it into what you need because you have the infrastructure to do so: you know how to make or repair the thing, you have the tools you need, you've practiced the skills you'll be using so you're not in unknown waters, and you know how to make the time to do the thing and get it done.

Newbies to repair and making have none of that. Newbies especially don't have years of previous mistakes to build from (let's be real, we learn the most from mistakes). They don't have the experience to know how to fix their mistakes or be assured that they'll be able to live with imperfect repairs and bad makes. They don't even know what they need to learn in order to do the thing.

The most frugal option in any given situation is the one you can actually *do* with the resources you have. Buying from Amazon may be penny smarter, but buying *the wrong thing* from Amazon because you thought you understood what you were buying but didn't and didn't get what you needed isn't. Buying something without a clear idea of the tools you need before doing so, only to discover the tools you need are *hundreds* of dollars or require a ton of practice and education before you can do the thing is not frugal. It's also not frugal to buy tools and materials you don't know how to use and destroying them in the process of doing the thing because you don't know how to use them.

Repair is a *skill*. It's a really valuable skill, actually. It's a skill that most of us have to teach ourselves because we don't have access to thriving repair communities. Self-teaching is really hard and rife with time, material, and financial expense.

And honestly repairing or making out of upcycled materials is *even harder*, though it's the literal cheapest option. It requires taking trash and turning it into a usable material before you even get to do the thing.

Your time is more valuable than your money. Your skills are more valuable than both. Your knowledge is priceless. Don't devalue yourself so by forgetting how much wealth you have in your non-financial resources when considering how to resolve someone's question. Also don't discount the human resources in physical stores. The value of the ability to show a newbie how to figure out what they need to complete a task is immeasurable.

I flaired this ""discussion"" because I want to end the post by inviting skilled folks to come to this table. What are tips you have and would like to share regarding the skills you have? What tips would you give newbies on finding the right tools and/or determining what materials work for a project? What is your process for identifying and executing the needed steps to take so you can make or repair something in your skillset?

The **most** frugal option is freely sharing knowledge and support.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,"Y'all don't value your time or knowledge and that's skewing your sense of what's ""frugal"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/rzebfj/yall_dont_value_your_time_or_knowledge_and_thats/,all_ads,t3_rzebfj,3045,0.9200000166893,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2247277.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,#dadada,48f4744c-4020-11eb-b280-0e0aa1878cbd,1579228575.0,t2_5agjvyuf,0.0,"{'gid_1': 4, 'gid_2': 1}",1.0,0.0,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 100, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 4, 'days_of_drip_extension': None, 'days_of_premium': None, 'description': ""Shows the Silver Award... and that's it."", 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'icon_width': 512, 'id': 'gid_1', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Silver', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'static_icon_width': 512, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}, {'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 500, 'coin_reward': 100, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': None, 'days_of_premium': 7, 'description': 'Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'icon_width': 512, 'id': 'gid_2', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Gold', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'static_icon_width': 512, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}, {'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 3, 'days_of_drip_extension': None, 'days_of_premium': None, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

Nothing makes me happier than a big Costco trip. I recently became a mother  and my baby only tolerates pampers which they only sell at Sam’s club. 

Coincidentally they have a Sam’s club membership on Groupon for only $25.00 right now. So I went ahead and bought it. If you use their “scan and go” app within 60 days you also get a $20.00 gift card so basically the membership is 5.00

I thought I’d write out some of the pros and cons of both clubs in case it’s helpful to anyone on here. 

Sam’s Club
Pros
Membership is less expensive 45 normally,
and 25 with the Groupon deal,
Had noticeably more name brands,
Has gas discount (even for non members!) ,
Their app is pretty comprehensive and saves your receipts which is nice if you track expenses,
Had a better variety of reasonably sized items if you have a smaller family,
Had pampers for the lowest price I’ve found,
In my opinion had better frozen food variety 
Bigger alcohol variety 

Cons
Not as well stocked as Costco,
Was noticeably not as clean as Costco,
Employees were not as helpful or friendly as Costco,
Less items in their members mark brand than Costco has in their Kirkland brand,
Had more junk food and unhealthy items. This could be a pro for some but I feel like I can get healthy foods for a deal at Costco. 
Not as many samples 

Costco
Pros
Gas discount 
Kirkland brand! Cheaper and amazing quality
Friendly and helpful employees,
The company also is known for paying employees well and offering more benefits than Sam’s club which I like to support,
Wide variety of fresh produce,
Larger warehouse (at least in my area),
More clothes offerings 

Cons
Less name brand items,
More expensive membership 60.00 for regular membership 


Ok so I couldn’t really think of many Costco cons 😂 and some of these might just be for my locations. Either way I hope this is helpful to someone. If anything the Groupon hack is helpful especially if your a parent needing a specific brand.

If you didn't already know, a basic membership at costco is $55 per year and that also covers the annual fee on an American Express card too if you get the costco branded card. 

So if you buy 1 year supply of certain brands and makes of contacts, costco will give you a $50 gift card good for anything in the store, including gas. 

This brings the effective cost of the contacts from $40 per box down to $33.75 per box since costco doesn't charge tax on the order.

I have been busting my ass trying to interview for new positions, and simultaneously studying for a new certification which would allow me to diversify my job search. I saved well before i lost my job (I worked to put 50+% of my income into savings every month,) but I live in a VERY high cost of living area (Silicon Valley/Bay Area) and am thus SCARED, especially given the economy...

 Can you guys help me see ANY other places I can/should be cutting my expenses during this lean time, so my unemployment/savings last me as long as possible?

- I split my (high) rent with 2 roommates. My lease forbids me from adding additional tenants, so I can't further lower my rent payment. I am stuck on this lease through December, but will certainly find a cheaper place after that if i am still un[der]employed.

- no cable. BF, who is one of my roommates, picks up the Netflix streaming tab ('cause he's awesome). We have wireless internet which we split (and which I feel I need to maintain sanity/continue my job hunt/certification process.)

- I do not have a smart phone or data plan. Just a feature phone. how much should i be paying through Verizon on my plan (which includes both texts and calling)? i am not under a contract and would change plans if it would save me $$. No landline.

- Utilities: no heating or cooling needed, except for nights during the coldest month of the year. i'm putting up post-its reminding people to turn off the lights, but i'm assuming there are other places my electricity is going. should i be pulling plugs? discouraging people from constantly opening the fridge? etc...

- no eating out. Ever. BF and I picnic often, so that's a little like eating out.

- i have a cat i acquired during my foolish,arrogant years living high on the hog (read: when i had a job). He know's he's on thin ice (kidding). he plays with cardboard boxes and the plastic loop that comes off the gallon of milk. i'm not willing to give him low-quality food or neglect any medical needs of his, but would switch litter methods if someone knew a good, cheap, humane option. right now I use Ever Clean because it does a very good job of suppressing odors. 

- I am avoiding using my car to the extent possilble. I need to lose weight anyway, so i have been walking to the grocery store, bank, pharmacy, etc. (I live close enough). i try to do everything else on my bike. when i do go somewhere, i try to ride with roommate, who has a prius, and give her 1-2 bucks for gas. should I do something else? my car is a 7 year old saturn station wagon. should i sell it? i might end up needing it if i can't find a job in Cali and move home...

- I got three months of BC before I lost my health insurance. i am now officially uninsured. I am confused, both financially and ethically, about how to proceed here. Should i try to get private health insurance (which i assume is CRAZY expensive and would likely double or more my expenses)? I'm 27 and in (as near as I can tell) good health (but of course there are many things i cannot predict/control)...this keeps me up at night.

- don't have a washer/dryer, but my apt. complex is $1wash/$0.75 dry. I don't dry anymore, i hang everything. 

- cooking is based on whatever in the fridge is going bad first. i buy bananas, whatever other fruit is cheapest (sometimes frozen mixed fruit, sometimes a 10lb bag of oranges.) i go to tj's, the farmer's mkt, Costco (roommate's membership) and the Mexican grocery store. i keep a price book. any good tips on wasting less food? i'm still struggling here..

- no gym. bodyweight exercises, i have a 16kg kettlebell and a bike.

- no drinking alcohol, soda,etc. waste of $. I drink water and milk. My milk is the gallon from Trader Joes, and the household always gets through it before it sours. should i switch to powdered milk or something else? is there substantial savings? what's the difference in taste?

- i get brown rice, flour, oatmeal, almonds, and a few other things from Costco. I already have PLENTY of properly packaged/stored yeast (bought SAF from Amazon about a year ago). I make my own bread, pasta, pizza dough, etc. we make brown rice at least once a week. Lately, I've been trying to lose weight, so we have not eaten as many carbs, but the carbs we do eat are from scratch. I am going to add dried legumes into the weekly rotation.

I have been busting my ass trying to interview for new positions, and simultaneously studying for a new certification which would allow me to diversify my job search. I saved well before i lost my job (I worked to put 50+% of my income into savings every month,) but I live in a VERY high cost of living area (Silicon Valley/Bay Area) and am thus SCARED, especially given the economy...</p>

<p>Can you guys help me see ANY other places I can/should be cutting my expenses during this lean time, so my unemployment/savings last me as long as possible?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I split my (high) rent with 2 roommates. My lease forbids me from adding additional tenants, so I can&#39;t further lower my rent payment. I am stuck on this lease through December, but will certainly find a cheaper place after that if i am still un[der]employed.</p></li>
<li><p>no cable. BF, who is one of my roommates, picks up the Netflix streaming tab (&#39;cause he&#39;s awesome). We have wireless internet which we split (and which I feel I need to maintain sanity/continue my job hunt/certification process.)</p></li>
<li><p>I do not have a smart phone or data plan. Just a feature phone. how much should i be paying through Verizon on my plan (which includes both texts and calling)? i am not under a contract and would change plans if it would save me $$. No landline.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilities: no heating or cooling needed, except for nights during the coldest month of the year. i&#39;m putting up post-its reminding people to turn off the lights, but i&#39;m assuming there are other places my electricity is going. should i be pulling plugs? discouraging people from constantly opening the fridge? etc...</p></li>
<li><p>no eating out. Ever. BF and I picnic often, so that&#39;s a little like eating out.</p></li>
<li><p>i have a cat i acquired during my foolish,arrogant years living high on the hog (read: when i had a job). He know&#39;s he&#39;s on thin ice (kidding). he plays with cardboard boxes and the plastic loop that comes off the gallon of milk. i&#39;m not willing to give him low-quality food or neglect any medical needs of his, but would switch litter methods if someone knew a good, cheap, humane option. right now I use Ever Clean because it does a very good job of suppressing odors. </p></li>
<li><p>I am avoiding using my car to the extent possilble. I need to lose weight anyway, so i have been walking to the grocery store, bank, pharmacy, etc. (I live close enough). i try to do everything else on my bike. when i do go somewhere, i try to ride with roommate, who has a prius, and give her 1-2 bucks for gas. should I do something else? my car is a 7 year old saturn station wagon. should i sell it? i might end up needing it if i can&#39;t find a job in Cali and move home...</p></li>
<li><p>I got three months of BC before I lost my health insurance. i am now officially uninsured. I am confused, both financially and ethically, about how to proceed here. Should i try to get private health insurance (which i assume is CRAZY expensive and would likely double or more my expenses)? I&#39;m 27 and in (as near as I can tell) good health (but of course there are many things i cannot predict/control)...this keeps me up at night.</p></li>
<li><p>don&#39;t have a washer/dryer, but my apt. complex is $1wash/$0.75 dry. I don&#39;t dry anymore, i hang everything. </p></li>
<li><p>cooking is based on whatever in the fridge is going bad first. i buy bananas, whatever other fruit is cheapest (sometimes frozen mixed fruit, sometimes a 10lb bag of oranges.) i go to tj&#39;s, the farmer&#39;s mkt, Costco (roommate&#39;s membership) and the Mexican grocery store. i keep a price book. any good tips on wasting less food? i&#39;m still struggling here..</p></li>
<li><p>no gym. bodyweight exercises, i have a 16kg kettlebell and a bike.</p></li>
<li><p>no drinking alcohol, soda,etc. waste of $. I drink water and milk. My milk is the gallon from Trader Joes, and the household always gets through it before it sours. should i switch to powdered milk or something else? is there substantial savings? what&#39;s the difference in taste?</p></li>
<li><p>i get brown rice, flour, oatmeal, almonds, and a few other things from Costco. I already have PLENTY of properly packaged/stored yeast (bought SAF from Amazon about a year ago). I make my own bread, pasta, pizza dough, etc. we make brown rice at least once a week. Lately, I&#39;ve been trying to lose weight, so we have not eaten as many carbs, but the carbs we do eat are from scratch. I am going to add dried legumes into the weekly rotation.</p></li>
<li><p>i buy my meat in bulk to portion and freeze. i watch for sales, and buy up when chicken is $1/lb or less, and beef is $2/lb or less. We eat a lot of eggs. </p></li>

For some context, I am a 32 year old man living out of his car, delivering pizzas.

For my entire adult life, I have never had more than $200 to my name at any given moment. Sure I've paid bills, rent, taxes, even put myself through college while.living in a homeless shelter, but I've never been more than $200 away from being broke.

At the time of writing this, I currently have $600 liquidity on me. My car insurance and my Phone bill are paid through August, and I have a full tank of gas.

I make 9.30 an hour and start each day by filling my tank and buying breakfast for myself. Despite this, I have more money than ever.

The fuck is going on?


Update: Wow, did not expect this kind of response. Thank you so much for the support!

At the time of writing this update, I've been awake for maybe 30 minutes. I'm about to buy gas from sams club, which is the cheapest in my area at $2.51 a gallon. I have 13 gallon tank in my saturn. Normally ondontnlet the tank get below 75%, but I forgot to fill ip yesterday, and my tank was at 25% when I got here.

For breakfast I do have food stamps, so I'm not sure how to legitimately count that in my expenses. Ill almost always get a banana, a cold coffee of some kind, and some deli meat/cheese with bread. Make a cheap ass sandwich. Runs me about 10/12 bucks.

For lunch I get a free menu item at work, and all the soda I want, though I should really stick to water... sometimes at the end of my shift, there are canceled/remade orders that I get to take with me. What I dont eat, I give to some of the homeless in the aurora area.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,public,,self,,,I dont understand.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/mp7jmm/i_dont_understand/,all_ads,t3_mp7jmm,618,0.910000026226043,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,1837506.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,,,1590267417.0,t2_6jw0jb88,0.0,{'gid_1': 1},1.0,0.0,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

Do you guys have any frugal tips to help us avoid spending lots of money while we're away, and still have a nice time and not make our friends feel awkward? What are some good ways you have found for politely turning down eating out, expensive activities, etc, and perhaps suggesting cheaper activities and eating options in ways that own't make people feel uncomfortable?

I'm a bit library users and I had never known that. I'm also a huge programming hobbyist who will often buy courses or books (that aren't available at the library) as means to pursue that. Needless to say,  I'm pretty excited and this will almost certainly save me a nice chunk of change (probably about $40 a month that I budgeted for hobbies). That leads me to ask the question, are there other free goods and services available through the library, other municipal organizations, or organizations I could join or already pay for (credit card benefits maybe?) which most people wouldn't know about and I may be missing out on? Sorry for the wall of text, all responses appreciated.

TL;DR - Are there free things from the library/city/etc. other than books and movies that I (or most people) are probably missing out on?

I lived in Australia for 15 years. I first attempted to move back to the U.S. in 2019. Got an apartment in the suburbs of Atlanta. Got let go from my full time job 10 days after we moved in. Spent the next 6 months only being able to find very low paying part time jobs and resorted to credit cards to keep us afloat. 

After that experience, when covid happened, I decided to return to Australia but I don't want to live there for reasons I won't get into here. 

I spoke to my daughter's father who lives in the Atlanta suburbs and he said if we came back,we could stay with him until I sorted out the mess I had gotten myself into with credit cards.

 We've been back here in the Atlanta area for 4 months now and i've spent everything i've made wheeling and dealing with collection agencies to get my credit score high enough to be able to rent again. It's up 110 points but my fico score is still 550 which to my knowledge is not high enough to qualify for a rental. 

I was not aware,being in Australia for the past year and a half that inflation and rental prices had skyrocketed here (I looked up that former apartment out of curiosity a couple of weeks back and it now rents for 1k more than what I was paying in 2019) 

My daughter's father we are staying with got angry with my son and gave me 30 days to get out. The rental prices around Atlanta are so high now that I don't think my daughter and I can swing a 3 bedroom place even if my credit was where it needs to be. My other 2 children are middle school age so they aren't old enough to help. 

Can anyone help me with ideas on cities or states where I can rent a 3 bedroom apartment or house that's still somewhat affordable? As well as jobs? And if it's not too much to ask, hopefully not crazy high violent crime rates? 

We both currently work but only make 25 an hour between the two of us. I have no family or friends who we are able to stay with. I do have a car so I guess we can sleep in it worst case scenario but obviously, i'd rather not do that to my kids.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,Where is a cheap place to start over in the U.S. as a single parent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/tajq2p/where_is_a_cheap_place_to_start_over_in_the_us_as/,all_ads,t3_tajq2p,23,0.7799999713897701,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2244944.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,#ea0027,643ceba8-4020-11eb-a2e3-0e6beef50dd5,1544597981.0,t2_2rp9oohh,0.0,{},1.0,0.0,[],0.0,1.0,,0.0,[],,,[],0.0,1654074524.0,,,,,,,,,,,True,,

I am hoping that you guys can share some tips regarding hospital bills. I had to take in my boyfriend to the ER after his cellulitis (skin staph infection) wasn't responding to antibiotics. It had spread down his leg so after an xray and a blood test they admitted him for IV antibiotics. He does have insurance (Florida Blue Cross/Blue Shield) but from what we could find on the insurance webportal its a flat $175 for ER visit, then they cover 20% of the cost for a hospital inpatient treatment. 

So far after talking with friends and looking online, I think the bill will land somewhere between $18k to $25k. Between his overnight stay, xray, blood test, MRSA test, IV antibiotics etc this is what I came up with.

I haven't had a serious hospital bill like this before so I have no idea how it works. Is the bill due immediately? Are there payment plans I can request? Aid to try to get my boyfriend qualified for? I have about $6k available, he has $2k available but both of us can dip into savings/stocks but I want to avoid that. What should or can I do right now?

Edit: You guys are absolutely right about my misinterpretation of insurance coverage. His insurance maximum out of pocket expense is $3950 and insurance will cover 80% of costs, the 20% is what we're responsible for. Thank you all for your comments, both those and this experience has been a real eye-opener. We really should've figured out things like this much earlier.

Unfortunately the MRSA test came back positive and they're keeping him for another night. Tomorrow morning (8-24) they'll assess him and we'll go over outpatient options. It looks like we can do the IV treatments at a clinic if he gets better. So far I've been bringing him most meals and no other procedures have been going on aside from the IV antibiotics so hopefully the two days in the hospital won't skyrocket into a crazy bill. I admit so much weight lifted off our shoulders after reading comments and his policy more thoroughly and we realized we only cover 20%.

His MRSA is still spreading though, but much more slowly. Freaking scary shit, I encourage all of you to seek more help if an infection resists antibiotics. The second visit to the clinic was effectively a waste of time and money, his infection was bright red and spreading so we already knew that we were going to end up in the ER.",,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,,,self,,,How do I keep hospital costs down?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/2ecqnl/how_do_i_keep_hospital_costs_down/,,t3_2ecqnl,124,1.0,,,,,,,,1408787527.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,

I have sold bras before and as long as the buyer pays for them it has been a smooth transaction. I refer to creeps as buyers I have come across that bypass the typical sales approach.

Living a better life (according to the internet, at least) involves eating hard to pronounce super food like quinoa, using tofu and tempeh, buying an obscene amount of kale and arugula, and living off a diet that would not only satisfy a fancy goat, but also burn a hole through your wallet. Which is why many people, despite their desire to live a healthy life, make excuses and continue eating their dollar burgers because they think that unhealthy food is cheaper to buy compared to going broke making their own food.

And that’s the trouble with the internet.

But worry not, you can live a healthy lifestyle cheaply and have Instagram-worthy food pictures. All you need is a little creativity and some practical advice on how to achieve the goal of eating healthy on a budget. 
 
Step 1: Survey Your Kitchen
Most people assume that you have to completely overhaul your kitchen to truly start your journey to wellness, but that is not so. Just do an inventory of your kitchen and it will reveal a wonderful treasure trove. Spices, dried herbs, salt and pepper are as good a start as any, as flavor is the basis of a great tasting meal. Then stock up on sauces and the like continuously and pretty soon, you’ll be consciously reaching for the healthier option.

Step 2: Buy in Bulk
Buy food in bulk. Rice, beans, and grains are cheaper in bulk and can last you a very long time. Stocking up also on canned vegetables like garbanzos, corn, baby corn, peas, black beans (to name a few), and fruits will save you a lot of money. Being preserved on the day they were picked keeps their nutritional value and will keep for a very long time on your cupboard. As for more expensive ingredients like olive oil, it’s usually cheaper to buy the liter instead of the smaller bottles. So remember, go big and then go home.

Step 3: Substitute, Research, and Improvise
So some things might be way out of the budget, but that’s fine since there are a variety of healthy substitutes you can use. Instead of olive oil, use soya bean oil. There are hundreds of websites on the internet dedicated to substitutions, beginner cooks, and nutrition. Instead of digesting drama on Facebook, use your internet time to research recipes and learn a thing or two about eating better.

Step 4: Cook and Freeze  
Another main problem of people who have a limited budget for eating healthy is the time they have, which is little to none because they are hard at work trying not to be broke. So to save yourself when landing in this position, cook a big batch of veggies and rice and freeze them to later thaw and mix during the lean times.  

Step 5: Buy Local
If your area doesn’t naturally produce the product, don’t buy it. Simple as that.  A huge part of the cost of any item is the shipping and transportation, and you don’t want to waste your money on that. Look for the nearest farmer’s market or if there are none, buy produce native to your area. 

These are just a few steps, but it proves that you can eat healthy on a budget. The only real obstacle is in your way of thinking, so change it up and then change your life for the better.

Due to the nature of my work, I can't really communicate with the outside world during work hours, so I can't have my phone at my desk and I can't access most websites.

But say you're in a hurry and you need a caffeine fix, or you're a tea junkie like me and couldn't wait for your kettle to boil some water before your class/work/whatever. Or maybe your with some friends who all want to go to Starbucks (Because, say what you will about Starbucks, but if you want a place to hang out with your friends other than your house, Starbucks is much cheaper than a restaurant or bar), how can you save money?

I've worked at Starbucks a long time now, and there's a few things you can do to hack the system. 

Brewed coffee is cheap enough. Ask for a pour over of their bold coffee for a fresher cup. It takes a few minuets, but it's fresher and costs the same amount. Also, if you and several of your friends all want coffee, ask for a French Press. It's around 4 dollars and is approximately 45 oz of fresh, hot, French pressed coffee. *And* you can pick whichever blend you'd like. 

If you want espresso, avoid the options already on the menu board. Americanos cost just a little more than a cup of brewed coffee, but packs more of a caffeine punch because it's espresso and hot water. It tastes like coffee and you can sweeten it just like you would your normal cup of coffee. More bang for your buck. If you want an extra shot, don't ask for one. Ask for a ""grande Americano in a tall cup"". That way, they charge you an extra 30 cents, instead of an extra 70 cents for the shot of espresso. This works because Grande Americanos get three shots. Same would work for a Venti. My manager tells all his partners to do this by default, whether the customer asks for it that way or not, but other stores may not be so nice. 

If you like iced drinks, asking for a triple espresso in a Venti cup over ice, and then filling it with milk after the fact at the condiment bar is a great way to get an iced latte for about 2 dollars. Even adding a flavor (which is 40 cents extra) still saves you about 50%. Unfortunately, there's no real way to do this with hot lattes, as you need a barista to steam the milk for you. 

If you and a friend are out and want a Frappuccino, ask for a Venti split into two tall cups. Iced venti cups are 24 oz. Tall are 12. Viola. Two talls would cost you about 6 bucks, a venti, 4. 

If you are secretly a Starbucks junkie, there's a new loyalty program Starbucks came out with. You get a Starbucks gift card (Not credit), register it online, and pay with your card each time, reloading it as you go. You get a free drink (Any kind of drink, not matter how expensive) every 10 transactions or so. You get a free tall coffee with each purchase of a 1lb of coffee and a free tall drink of your choice for each 2lbs. You also get a free drink on your birthday. If you have one of these, and are getting drinks for multiple people, ring up each drink separately. 

Also, if you want a good coffee that is also quick and easy, Starbucks is pressuring their stores *profusely* to up their VIA sales. It's instant, water soluble coffee. No chemicals, no freeze drying. Actually quite good. I've used it when I'm staying in a hotel and it tastes just like coffee (Get the bold Italian Roast though, not the Colombian). A 12 pack of that stuff is $9.95. Not bad price per cup. And it dissolves in hot or cold water and even milk (.98 cent latte anyone?). It's a good gift for someone who works in an office with bad coffee or travels a lot. It's also wonderful in cooking. Act very skeptical and ask a lot of questions about it. If you don't get offered a free drink or some other deal with it within 2 minuets, I'd be very surprised. 

Also, if you buy Starbucks coffee in a grocery store, it will come with a coupon for a free tall cup of coffee. In actuality, the ring code works for any size. In addition to that, if you want a more expensive drink, we can take the price of a tall coffee off for you from the original price. Also, talk about how you're now out of coffee. The barista will most likely offer you a pound of our coffee for the same price as the grocery store coffee (The grocery store coffee is a smaller bag and is around 7 dollars, the bags in retail stores are 1lb and cost about 9 or 10). They can also grind it custom for you. As a side note, you can get any of our coffees weighed out. You can buy a full 1lb, a 1/2lb and a 1/4lb. 

Also, make friends with a barista. They will most likely hook you up with free drinks a lot. Further more, if you get to be really good friends, Starbucks baristas get a weekly coffee/tea/VIA markout. My boyfriend's parents and my parents never have to buy coffee because I get it for free. Furthermore, we get partner shopping days around the holidays, 40% off everything. Starbucks is a great place to get presents for those people you don't know very well (distant co-workers, secret santas, teachers, etc) and you can save a lot of money by asking a barista you know to buy it for you. 

Also, you get 10 cents off your drink if you bring in your own cup/use one of ours. 

Let me just say, that a lot of people don't understand why Starbucks drinks are so expensive. We *hand-make everything*. Well, not everything, but most of it. We make our own whipped cream, the Frappuccinos are hand made with real coffee and milk, teas are full leaf, the mocha is made fresh everyday and the Chai concentrate is all natural. You can get whatever drink you can possibly think of. Our pasteries are now made without HFCS, artificial colors, or preservatives. Our coffees are sourced ethically (Bucks pays a higher price for raw coffee than say, Folgers or DD and all of the espresso and brewed coffee in European stores are certified Fair Trade), and, further more, they treat their employees well. That's not say we get paid well or that there isn't bullshit politics, but every barista, part time or full, is given cheap health coverage, 401k, stock options, savings plans, tuition reimbursement, etc, etc. Last year each partner was given a stock grant, and this year we're each getting a bonus and generous matches on our 401ks because of Starbucks' success in pulling out of the recession pretty damn well. Furthermore, baristas are specially trained and certified. Yes, not all of them are worth a shit, but we're not simply counter-help. We learn how to properly froth milk, how to discern different flavor notes in a coffee, etc. Ask someone at DD what the difference between a coffee grown in Latin America as opposed to Indonesia, and they'll look at you like you have two heads. 

A good way to tell if a store is good or not is through two ways:

* Drive Thrus. Many drive thru stores are not as good as a cafe-only store. But say that a drive-thru store also has...

* Newer espresso machines. The older ones have the separate hoppers for the decaf and espresso beans and have two metal steam wands. The newer ones have a retro look to them, with pink enamel on the back and a flying-saucer looking hopper on top. The stores with these machines make more money, and therefore probably have better management/better staff. Also, the espresso is better from these machines, as the shots are timed with each pour, so the barista can better maintain the quality of the pour. The old machines had to be timed and calibrated every four hours or so, and, a lot of times, that just doesn't get done.

* However, unlike the new machines, the old machines can only pour two shots at a time. That means if you get a Grande Americano with three shots, will have a fourth one going down the drain, unless you ask the barista nicely if they could throw it in for you. Sometimes, if you're friendly from the get go, the barista will just do it anyways. And viola! Free shot.  

ALSO. Not that I would believe any of you to be guilty of this, but if you're bitchy to a barista, you're possibility of them 'accidentally' giving you decaf just went up about 70%. By the same token, complimenting the barista on bar on the quality of your drink will pretty much be the highlight of their day. I can say from experience, a man once said to me ""You're so smart [sip] and you make a damn good cappuccino,"" the cappuccino part was the one that stayed with me. 

Hope this helps you save a bit! Happy coffee drinking!

EDIT: 
Finally, if you come in and ask for a cup of coffee and see that the little red light on the brewer is blinking, ask politely for a fresher batch, or just go with a pour over. The red light starts blinking after an hour. At my store, we're pretty strict about the 30 minute time limit on our coffees, but other stores aren't.

It didn’t take long for me to realize that I made a terrible decision, but it’s too late now. Not long after, I started having some issues which resulted in over $2,000 in repairs. My dad is a “car guy” and we both decided that the repairs would be worth it and the car would be fine afterwards. Shortly after this, we discovered that there is a manufacturer defect with my car that causes it to over consume oil which causes other mechanical issues if not caught in time. I refill my oil often and have to go in for oil changes more frequently than most people. I also was in an accident on the interstate a while back which caused a lot of damage to my car, which was repaired. But I recently had trouble with my car which I believe had something to do with the repairs done after this accident (which was over 2 years ago, so who knows). 


I simply do not trust my car for long drives, which sucks because my boyfriend and I like to travel, but I don’t know how to drive his manual so he’s always stuck doing the driving. I also live in an area that is not walkable and has really shitty public transport so having a vehicle is a must for me. 

I know I’ll be upside down on the loan if it trade it in. I’ve got it up to over 120k miles and I still owe over $7,000 on it. I don’t have the money to pay it off in one lump sum and if I get a new car, I’ll have to finance that one as well. Basically I’ll be in debt either way. 

So... do I put myself in more debt by buying a newer, safer, more reliable car now? Or do I wait until this one dies and put myself in a stressful situation?",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,Be upside down on my car loan or hang onto a car that may or may not last?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/og8ll4/be_upside_down_on_my_car_loan_or_hang_onto_a_car/,all_ads,t3_og8ll4,4,0.7099999785423271,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2296081.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,#dadada,643ceba8-4020-11eb-a2e3-0e6beef50dd5,,,0.0,{},1.0,,[],0.0,0.0,,,[],,,[],0.0,1656214383.0,,,,,,,,,,,True,,

What products would you argue are actually more worth buying now then they were years ago? 

For example tvs are really cheap now, and while coffee and dining out are more expensive, the price increase of simple fast food is insane. 

You often have the option of eating at a dine in restaurant for only a few more dollars than going to a fast food place, and the increase in the price of latte is not nearly as drastic as say the 1 dollar cheeseburger, which is now 3 dollars no matter where you look.  

So dine in food and coffee has gone up a few dollars, while fast food has double or tripled in price, making fast food and coffee feel more “worth it”. Any other examples of this.

I started skipping breakfast and lunch due to there being no food (or only food enough for younger subs) in my teens, started working 2-3 jobs (90+ hours per week) and 25yrs later I still eat the same. I realize it’s not healthy, but I get nauseated if I eat more than a nibble generally before noon, and I’m generally not hungry until after 4pm. So I just eat 1x a day.

Which is fine, hasn’t killed me in 25yrs. I’m working on doing better.

That being said, my 5’4, 80lb son (he will be 11 in dec) easily eats breakfast, sneaks 3 zbars (kids cliff bars) for his school snack, lunch, snack in afternoon, and then literally eats more than my dinner.

He’s going to be a monster (predicted height is 6’6-6’8 normal for my family actually) and is a string bean. So  not worried about how much he’s eating.

His older brother is 13 (14 end of jan) 5’8, 135lbs, and as of last week a size 10.5 shoe. This kid can sit down and eat a full chipotle burrito bowl, the 2/3rds of mine I can’t finish, and ask for dessert. 
Giant jersey mikes sub with plenty of lettuce and tomatoes etc is no Trouble. 

The other day he polished off a bigger burger than my 300lb 6’3 “baby” brother 

He’s getting a smidge of chub, but compared to his peers he’s still average/thin. 
Since we have weight issues in the family on my ex’s side as well as mine... I’m a bit worried about his beldar level scarfing. But he’s also shooting up so I expect he’s fine.

My issue is not only are they all “hey, can I eat your meal too mom?” But the fact they are eating me out of house and home!!!

I know how to cook cheap but admittedly I work long hours (80+ hr weeks are normal for me) and even cooking 3lbs of taco meat is met with “still hungry” comments.

I cook them scrambled eggs for dinner and they easily plow through a dozen + by themselves.

I’m about to hit thag crazy coupon lady who stores hoard under beds level of stockpiling ramen and baked beans.


Any idea for cheap but filling pre-wrapped snacks for elementary guy outside of cliff type bars? They can’t take a BUNCH of stuff to schools. Such a pain.

Also, besides making a pot of rice/beans/noodles etc to fill them up alongside dinner, any other suggestions to fill the creatures up?

Upon seeing the model number to make sure it was the same one as Amazon, I noticed a 'WM' after the usual model number.

I compared them on Walmart's website and Ninja's official website, and the one on Walmart is 100 watts less. 

I've heard of companies making different versions of the same product, one of which is made of cheaper materials so they can sell it at Walmart to meet their demands. Is this one case of it happening?

I don't usually spend money outside of bare necessities. And that's a childhood thing. My expenses account for about 47% of my income and that doesn't mean much cuz I don't make a lot, but I have a very comfortable amount of savings to my name. 

Usually I spend very little. I don't drink, i do buy weed, but that's accounted in my 47%. Now when I do spend, it us usally on something big, but the guilt just sits with me for a while. 

Today I was on my way to buy a new gaming PC that I have been looking forward to for a while. But literally the whole drive there I was just like ""oh I hope this is okay."" and on the drive I passed some folks begging and that just made me feel so much guilt. I constantly keep telling myself that I am spoiled, and I feel like I don't deserve many nice things. But I do work hard, don't cheat anyone out of money, earn and spend honestly. I am just sick of it.

My husband and I are moving back to MI from Las Vegas and my company is paying for the move. I have pods booked but I'm getting really worried about just having the one 7 foot container. I told the guy on the phone we have a 1 bedroom apartment, with about 2 and a half rooms of furniture (living room, dining room set, and bedroom). The sq foot is 717 and he recommend just 1 container.

Has anyone had experience with pods or even upack? (I know their size is similar). Is that really enough? I was actually considering cancelling pods and ordering upack's trailer. Even though my company is paying for the move it has to be under $5k total, and we are staying in a hotel with food paid for 2 weeks so the pods/upack can't be much more than $2k. Pods has me priced at almost exactly $2k for the 1 pod and upack at 1,900 if I only use 7 feet with the trailer (if I do use more, it most likely wouldn't be much more).

Any suggestions on this? Should I stop worrying and just keep pods?

My SO of four years has absolutely terrible financial hygiene.

We keep all our finances separate, and I will never marry him because I cannot fathom tying my finances to his in any way, shape or form.

Keeping things separate helps me stay in a zone of ""not my business, not my problem"" when it comes to his spending habits. He pays his bills on time and he is always on time with our agreed upon shared expenses. Otherwise, I wouldn't be in a relationship with him at all.

However, I do feel like I'm subsidizing his poor lifestyle choices fairly often, and it's a yucky feeling. He's got lavish tastes, and always wants the best of everything. Food, electronics, vehicles - he will never ""compromise on quality"". He refuses to eat leftovers because ""they don't taste as good the next day"". He knew for two years he needed to buy a new vehicle as his was failing, but he didn't manage to save a single penny for the down-payment over the course of two years.

He gets his paycheck, spends it all and his bank account has zero dollars in it before the next payday, every single time.

He makes decent money. I make a bit more than him. He never borrows money or asks me for money. But things I enjoy, like vacations, he doesn't see value in because they aren't tangible so he refuses to spend money on vacation - it's literally the only thing he won't spend money on. So if I want to go on vacation with him, either I plan and pay or he doesn't go. He's happy to spend all his vacation time sitting around the house doing nothing but sleeping and eating. I just can't do that, I want to go do fun things with my time off.

I understand that we are financially incompatible. I've asked him if he would like help with setting a budget, but he doesn't want me to see where he's spending his money because he knows I'm frugal and I would absolutely be telling him ""spending $500 on vehicle accessories when you have zero savings is unwise"".

He won't even cancel subscription services he never uses, for years.

He has enormous amounts of debt because of very, VERY bad decisions, but he doesn't learn from his mistakes at all.

Is there any way for me to help him? I feel like all my Frugal knowledge would be useful for someone with bad financial hygiene, but when that person is your partner advice feels like criticism - especially if your partner has no desire to change.

I guess I'm just venting. Is anyone else out there in a relationship with someone that has bad financial hygiene? Let's commiserate!

I deleted the post because I felt stupid lol and that I wasn't being frugal enough because I'm still wanting pricey things. But then I got to thinking that people might have different definitions of frugal? Right now frugal to me is: not buying everything my heart desires / not eating out all the time / not using credit cards unless I have an absolute emergency / looking for cheaper alternatives. Is this enough? Is it okay to still want pricey things once in a while or do I not fit the actual definition of frugal?

Really I was just trying to look for silver linings because I know that frugality pays off in the long run, but it's still a big adjustment for me. So being excited about a potential birthday gift was a short-term silver lining for me lol.

I’m  thinking about investing in new/used items that serve multiple purposes.

As examples:

1. There are a pair of super stretchy but good looking shorts I’ve seen (the thousand miles ones) where you can wear them to work out, to work, to a bar, etc. basically one pair of shorts can do it all. I like this concept. 

2. The idea of a jacket that performs all functions (especially when layered). Such as being waterproof, windproof, good in warm and cool weather, etc. 

Essentially, I dislike having a swimsuit that I wear about ten times a year when I should be utilizing my clothes as much as possible. 

And for those wanting to say “BUT LONGEVITYYYYYY! If you wear that swimsuit only ten times a year, then it’ll last forever”. Yeah I understand that but I would rather spend more money upfront on a multifunctional item and either purposely keep it in good shape, repair it when it’s broken, or just buy it again after I’ve literally used it every day for years.

An organization (corporation? nonprofit?) could become an intermediary that tells college bookstores to buy back certain outdated editions, where the organization then buys those from the bookstore.

Times are changing and vehicles are starting to get very complicated. Vehicles that are 2010 and newer you will not want to get serviced at any back yard shop any more (other then general maintenance). The computer systems are complex and require specific scan tools/ trained technicians.  
__Things you need to think about before going to a shop:__ 

* Am I sure I know what is wrong with my car? If not its best to get it diagnosed first. Its wasting your time and money if you do not know the fault. Expect most shops to start at an hour for diagnosis, but can go a little higher (for general concerns). Big diesel trucks performance diagnosis starts around 4 hours.  
* When going to a shop with your concern make sure you explain every detail. (ie; There is a noise in my front end, sounds to be coming from the left hand side when going over bumps. Only happens when it is cold outside.) Don't just say I hear a noise. Spend the time thinking about how to best explain the issue to someone.  
* All of your car information. Get your make, year, model, engine size, the more information the more accurately we can help you.
  
  __General things about shop:__

* Parts are complicated and mistakes happen allot. Some parts people rarely screw up, but most parts people screw up on a daily/weekly.  -Phone estimates are never accurate. If I see a car that is old and super rusty I know its going to be well over the book time so I can warn the customer before doing any repairs.  
* It never hurts to ask if they can give you a better deal. Generally $10 off the door rate is not uncommon. 
* You can always ask for aftermarket parts. Generally they're cheaper, but you get what you pay for. 

__Random side notes:__

* If your vehicle is under warranty, don't whine about every little thing. It is like the boy who cried wolf. IE: A guy brought his truck in with 5-6 warranty concerns. 
Line 1: My catalytic converter is leaking too much water.(The second I see this I think you're an idiot and have a hard time spending time on other concerns.) 
No shit its leaking water, that's the major by product of the chemical conversion. 
Line 2:When my lights are on auto and I drive threw a tunnel, my dash lights then dim. Can you turn this off? (LOL are you kidding me??? maybe leave your lights in the off position if you don't want them to automatically change.) This will end up getting you less in the long wrong because we don't trust you. It is a two way street this trust thing.
* Don't be afraid to ask to talk to the technician if you would like a better explanation. I love when they do this. It also gives you an idea on if they know what they're talking about.   
* Expect prices to be relative to the price of a vehicle. If you own a $60k truck repairs will be high. If you own a cheap stock focus, repairs will be much lower.   
* Maintenance is key!!!! You will pay in the long run if you don't. Ford has lots of information online on what needs to be done when.   
* Find a shop you like and stick with it. When we have complete vehicle history it helps so much!
* Lastly we're all human, mistakes do happen. I feel bad when they do. So please don't treat me badly if I do. Hate to be honest but why piss off the person that is trying to make your vehicle safe for you?

My process is quite simple: I will only spend money on Sundays.  The only exceptions include bills.  I could do bills only on Sunday as well, however it is very satisfying to me to get the notice in my email, pay it off immediately, and delete the email.  

So everything else: gas for my car, groceries, household items, even entertainment and date nights: only on Sunday. 

What its improved: 

No more unplanned date nights.  My boyfriend and I have found free ways to hang out together.  Library. Walks.  Bike rides.  Swimming at the gym.

You forgot to get gas?  Looks like you're biking to work.

No more ""oh no we ran out of limes"" gas wasting trips to the store.  Looks like that homemade salsa will go lime juice less... Or I'm making it on Sunday.

Backyard project needs extra bricks?  Yeah you should have planned that one better. 

It's really a punishment system that has made me more aware of where my money is going while also making me plan out my money better.  I had a real problem jumping on Facebook Marketplace and going ""omg what a steal"" and getting a 40$ item I really don't need.  I also had a habit of getting a drink/snack everytime I got gas.  

I did the math on my >10$ purchases and those purchaces made up 20% of my spending.  Most of those were unnecessary, or could have been cheaper if I got in bulk or at the same time to save gas.

Anyway, it works for me.  I've saved a lot in gas alone (gas buget has gone from 75 a month to 50 a month) and the reason why I consider it cleansing... Its so relaxing and puts my mind to ease that I have no errands to run after work.  I have that time to spend with my family and to myself.

Edit: for the record I have never ran out of gas and needed to bike to work, I have also never not allowed myself to enjoy life.  The gas/bike example was an extreme option but I wanted to make a point that it's about being prepared.  

The biggest point I tried to make was that this is my ""cold turkey"" way of limiting unnecessary purchases that ended up giving me more of what I ultimately want: more time with my significant other and my dogs and spending less on impulse buys. Nothing more.

I wanted to give a report on how much I paid so others have a reference.

I recently purchased a 2010 Toyota Prius II (with carpets and mats as extra options) for $22,498 with 0% APR financing for 60 months (5 years). My monthly payments are $404/mo for a grand total of $24,240 financed (I put tax, title, and license into the financing). I did a little bit of research before I purchased the vehicle, and I believe I can save money, but it's a gamble on how much the cost of fuel will rise.

The hybrid has a combined fuel efficiency of 50 MPG. Compare this to a Corolla that has a combined fuel efficiency of 29 MPG. The Corolla base model (after haggling) can come down to about $13,500. The difference in cost between the two vehicles is $9,000.

If you plan on keeping the vehicle for many years, maintenance costs will be roughly about the same excluding the life of the battery (which currently costs about $2000, and may reduce in price as time passes). The main difference is the cost of gas.

If we assume a yearly mileage of 15,000, and if we assume the price of gasoline to be $3.00 per gallon, annually, you will save $650. In 10 years, you will save $6,500 compared to the Corolla.

If we assume the price over 10 years to average out to $4.00 per gallon, you will save $870 per year or $8,700 for 10 years.

If we assume the price to be $5.00 per gallon, then you will save $10,800 over 10 years compared to the Corolla.

In the next 10 years, will the cost of gasoline average out to $5.00 per gallon? If so, the cost of the Prius (with nicer features) will equal the cost of purchasing a new Corolla. If it averages out less, then you lose a thousand or two over these 10 years.

I understand that there's also other considerations such as resale value and the Prius hatchback model is too new for me to accurately project into the future. The only figure I came up with is from KBB where a 2010 model with 15,000 miles on it costs $19,500. It's a sharp decrease initially.

I took a gamble with the cost of gas, but I believe that in 10 years, the cost will rise so dramatically that this hybrid/fuel efficient vehicle will be worth it. Feel free to discuss.

Edit: [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_and_diesel_usage_and_pricing#Typical_gasoline_prices_around_the_world) is the cost of gasoline by country. Apparently, the US has it good compared to many other countries.

I worked in meat, bakery, prepared foods, and produce at Whole Foods over the course of 3.5 years.  I had a 30% discount (you can get 20, 22, 27, or 30 percent depending on a yearly health screening), so I shopped there constantly.  Once I moved close to a neighborhood market, I found that a lot of the items I was buying at Whole Foods were more expensive than necessary, even with the discount.  But I want to share what's worth buying there and what's worth buying elsewhere.

First of all, DON'T shop at Jewel, Albertson's, Dominick's, Hyvee, whatever.  There's no reason to go to any of these when ALDI exists and when there's neighborhood markets to go to.

Do's and Don't at Whole Foods:

* **Oats, grains, and beans** are great at Whole Foods.  Shop in the bulk section.  Oats - including steel-cut oats - are $1.39 a pound.  Those steel-cut oats that come in a tin are like $6 a pound to my memory.  Even at my new grocery store, quick oats are $2 a pound, which is great, but I can't beat Whole Foods for grains.

* **Raisins** and some other dried fruits, also in the bulk section at Whole Foods.  Thompson raisins are $2.99 a pound, which is cheaper than the $3.99 I spend on raisins elsewhere.  

* *Don't*, however, buy **nuts** in the bulk section.  There are nuts that are like $17.99/lb.  Nuts that are $9.99 a pound at WF are $5.99/lb at my local market, and sometimes cheaper at ALDI.  For some nuts you sort of have to go to Whole Foods because there's nowhere else you can buy them in bulk - hazelnuts, chestnuts, macadamia nuts.

* Buy **produce** at ALDI or a local market.  WF jacks their prices, even for conventional produce.  Apples are like $2.99/lb to other stores' $1.69, and to my memory it's even cheaper at ALDI.  Bananas at ALDI are $.39/lb to $.69 elsewhere and $.79 at WF.

* Buy **meat** at a local market.  Go out of your way to do this, especially for ethnic meats (like various types of sausage - chorizo, kielbasa, knackwurst, bratwurst).  *Never, ever, ever buy chicken at WF.*  It's $6.99/lb compared to $2.99/lb elsewhere.  It's crazy.  The cheapest steak I've ever seen at WF is flatiron steak for $5.99/lb, which isn't bad, but any other steak is cheaper elsewhere, as is ground beef.

* Buy **bread** at WF, especially if you're into plain old white bread or wheat bread.  They're $2.99 a loaf and fresh-baked, and they can slice it for you (after they slice it, slice it in half down the middle for regular-sized pieces of bread).  Also, I'm sure you all know this, but freeze half your bread and keep half out.  I've had people say that they thought you shouldn't freeze bread - freezing it is fine, but don't put it in the fridge.  The moisture will make it stale.

* Buy **cakes** at Whole Foods, and specifically I mean the in-house made cakes.  It's a little more expensive (by maybe $2 or $3) than buying cakes at like Jewel or Albertsons or Dominick's, but A) the quality is insanely better - Whole Foods cakes have actual buttercream, whereas other stores use something called ""Bettercream"" that's made of chemicals and shit; and B) you can have them custom-decorate it, often for free or for a fee that's actually less than what other grocery stores charge.  Cakes are an occasion purchase and it's worth spending a little extra money for the quality.  I can say as a decorator in the bakery that we give extra time for free to cakes for really nice customers.  5-inch cakes are $11.99 and 8-inch cakes are $21.99.  If you have a hankering for a cake snack, slices are $2.99, also cheap.

* Buy **pies** elsewhere.  It's $6.99/pie at Whole Foods to $2.99 elsewhere.  Better yet, make your own pie.  It tastes better homemade and it's not that hard (if you need help with pie-making please feel free to ask me).

* Buy **dairy milk** at ALDI.  WF charges like $5.99 for conventional milk to ALDI's ~ $2.39.  

* Buy **yogurt** at Whole Foods, particularly Greek yogurt.  Greek yogurt is $5.99 for the 365 brand, compared to $7.99 for Fage anywhere else (I've seen it for $6.99, but still).

* Buy **butter** at ALDI.

* Buy **alternative milks** like almond or soy at Whole Foods.  This is really specific, though: the 2-packs of half gallons are $5.99 at WF.  The half gallons by themselves are $3.39, which is the same price you'll find them elsewhere.

* Buy **spices** at Whole Foods in the bulk section.  It's insanely cheap.  You'll spend like $5.99 for bottled spices both at Whole Foods and anywhere else to like $1 or $2 at Whole Foods.  I bought bottles to keep my spices at IKEA, and it was a really worthwhile purchase.  They were like $2 a bottle.  So $2 a bottle plus $2 for the spices on the first purchase still beats prices elsewhere, and from then on it's just the $2 for the spices.  And you can buy as much or as little as you actually need, which is great, because a lot of people waste spices.

* I don't buy **dry groceries** much anymore (cereals, pasta, anything that comes in a box), but they're hands-down cheapest at ALDI.

All right, that's my recommendations.  Any thoughts or suggestions, please post!

*** EDIT ***
DAMN GUYS I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD GET THIS MUCH ATTENTION.

OK, so on the **meat** issue: there are a LOT of us who cannot afford to shop for quality.  I'm trying to cater to those people with this list..  If you really care about the quality, shop at Whole Foods.  I agree that *usually* the steak in particular is more flavorful, but honestly, if you get yourself good at cooking, you can make any steak taste amazing.

And as far as the conditions they're raised in - again, a lot of us can't afford to care.  I guess you could say ""if you can't afford to care, don't buy it,"" but my experience tells me that including a fair amount of meat in my diet (contrary to what Whole Foods will tell you) is the healthiest way for me to function day-to-day.  And to be totally frank, you're buying stuff that's raised to be slaughtered - their whole life is only worth their death.  It doesn't matter what conditions they're raised in, that's cruel either way.  I mentioned in one comment that I made the decision about a year ago that I can only put my energies and time and money toward a few causes, and the conditions of slaughtered animals didn't make the list.  **That's just *my* thinking.**  I know a lot of you will disagree, and a lot of you will agree, so potato potahto tomato tomahto let's throw the whole thing out.

u/bbanana mentioned that you can make **Greek yogurt** by straining regular non-fat yogurt in a coffee filter.  PRO TIP!  Thank you so much!

**Specialty cheeses** are awesome at Whole Foods.  You can't find a lot of their cheeses anywhere else.  I don't buy them that often because they're sort of an occasion thing, but they're worth it for those occasions (for example: on the first frost of the year I make a celebratory dinner with mac & cheese and I buy smoked gouda, gruyere, and brie for it at WF).  For **regular cheeses**, like shredded cheddar - don't bother at Whole Foods.  It's the same cheese that comes in a bag anywhere else in terms of their processing.  It's like $5.99 a bag at WF and $2.49 elsewhere (ALDI and local markets).

I forgot to mention that **frozen fruits** are hands-down absolutely the cheapest I've ever seen at Whole Foods.  Frozen strawberries are $1.69 a bag, mango is I think $2.99, mixed berries are either $1.99 or $2.49.  You cannot beat those prices anywhere, even ALDI, to my memory.  **Frozen vegetables** are cheapest at ALDI, but they don't always have a great selection, and they are still pretty inexpensive at Whole Foods.

One 15 gallon sterilite tub with a 40 watt used fish tank heater.  

$5 toilet seat on $10 worth of lumber over top of a $5 barn muck bucket.

I paid about $40 for the new stuff and got the old used stuff for free.


Takes a little time but the water heats up to about 90 degrees for a warm shower.    For the toilet,  I use free sawdust as a filler.   Once it starts to get full it gets emptied into a compost pile which is awesome for your garden.

Based on 40 watts per hour and 9 cents per kWh on my bill running the heater for a month would run about $2.50.   I keep it off most of the time though and just fire it up before a shower.    On hot days (like today) the sun heats the water up for free.

I have a general question for the group that I have been thinking about for a few weeks.

I am a freelance web developer in my spare time, I work about 10 hours a week (outside of my 9 to 5) to bring in some extra money. I started freelancing because I wanted to pay to have my house cleaned once a month.  I discovered that I can make more money in three hours than it would cost to pay someone to clean my house. I make extra money on the side, and part of that goes towards not doing a bunch of chores when I get off work. Obviously I enjoy freelancing more than housecleaning.

Now, I want my couches cleaned (my regular housekeeper doesn't do that). I called around a few places and the cheapest couch cleaning I can get it $176 for two full size couches.

My big question is this: when it it worth it to outsource something like upholstery cleaning? I could spend a few hours doing some hard work and cleaning my couches, or I could just build someone a website and pay someone else to clean my couches.

We are saving every penny. With this being said, when I do graduate we are looking to live as cheap as possible with the least sacrifice of quality. We came to a conclusion of manufactured housing.

We would be able to buy with cash. We would be buying used of course. We understand the value of it will go down. We don't care as we don't plan on selling if we move we will buy land put the mobil home on the land and rent it out for income.

Our goal is to not spend more then 35k on the home. 
We are having trouble depicting how much utility's are. Once I'm done in school I am going to try and find my first entry level job in the south so I can ditch my car for a trike or moped. I have done the annual math yo our expenses as follows please adjust this were you need to so I can have a realistic idea of the cost to live in a paid of manufactured home.


Lot rent 4800 (trash included?)
Electricity 1200
Heat 1200
Water 600
Food for both of us. 2400
Moped/trike insurance 100
Moped gas 360
Phone 600
Internet 360
Total 11,620 annually


This is all I have for the essentials without killing our enjoyment I left out her vehicle because we are undecided on her getting a moped or car because of how expensive a car is annually with repairs abd what not are there any essential things I did not count? 

Secondary how much would we add to this number if we decide to have a kid? 300 a month I really have no clue on that front everyone says they are so rediculasly expensive, but the majority of amarica also doesn't know how to be thrifty and frugal anndd over spends in a heavy way.

Hopefully this will allow me to take care of these sopping student loans. I have to take 80 thousand frucki g dollars from a state university for my engineering degree... sooolo expensive...

Any feed back is welcomed! I am just trying to do my best and learn from other wise individuals and have minimal mistakes. I just see that because of bad decisions my grandparents can't retire and that scares the living crap out of me. Same with rents in my area being the cost of the notional wage avarage after you count for taxes. Very scary world today.

My other aunt would collect every gift bag, bow and tissue paper and then use those throughout the year for any gifts she had to give (birthdays, graduations, kids being born Christmas etc) .

My takehome is about $1078 per paycheck on average. As you can see, in that 26 bi-weekly period, there would be 3 paychecks where my bills are more than my takehome. (And 3 more paychecks where bills would take up nearly my whole check.) If every payday I paid my bills that were due, and considered the rest of the paycheck available for groceries, eating out, etc., there would be those paychecks that I was in hot water and start getting late fees, insufficient fund penalties, etc. because my check wasn't enough.

But then again, there's every so often where I would have nearly $800 leftover after paying all the bills that were due after that paycheck (and yes, these are typically near when I get 3 paychecks in a month). These are keys to breaking out of living paycheck-to-paycheck. You can see at the bottom of the picture that my average bills are $678, meaning my ""other"" spending available to me is $400/paycheck for food, clothes, gas, etc. 

If those ""extra"" paychecks I kept only spending $400 on the misc./""nonbill"" spending and SAVED that extra $400 instead of seeing $800 of available money and spending all of it, eventually I would have enough buffer built up. I'd never again need to scramble during those paychecks where my bills exceed my income.

So **MY SIMPLE SYSTEM FOR HOW I PERSONALLY STOPPED LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK**: what I do is get that $400 directly deposited into a separate checking account when I get paid. I can spend that entire $400 on groceries, movies, concerts, booze, whatever. I ALWAYS can spend that $400 each check (or save it for vacations, put extra towards debt, whatever my goals are). The rest of my paycheck, the other $678, gets deposited into the ""bills"" checking account which is essentially always at $0 available. I may look at it today and it may have a $1200 balance sometimes. But this chart I've linked to shows how I don't REALLY have $1200, since eventually it will be needed for some future bill.

This way, there's always the money for those set bills, and I don't really have to ""budget"" each month. An emergency fund for unexpected expenses helps, too. But forecasting for the next year and getting that average amount directly deposited made the biggest difference for me when I was starting out.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,public,,self,,,Bi-weekly pay // Monthly bills // Why there's never an entire extra check & How to stop living paycheck to paycheck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/862fhb/biweekly_pay_monthly_bills_why_theres_never_an/,all_ads,t3_862fhb,37,1.0,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'sMoyA-NnILHRaB4EEJMPNjkioBRyUahk_AVaxmE9TBw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 213, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/wsZHQykDMgOE_tQ0vat13jTGYlu9ePXthUlkKR9g45g.jpg?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=108&s=e375c01be062dd8f2be50a5fd7268e14', 'width': 108}, {'height': 427, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/wsZHQykDMgOE_tQ0vat13jTGYlu9ePXthUlkKR9g45g.jpg?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=216&s=c8ef37bd57ad8d9b1001bc370e3148f4', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 552, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/wsZHQykDMgOE_tQ0vat13jTGYlu9ePXthUlkKR9g45g.jpg?s=5008e5dc7b85f660f49c2313e37725c4', 'width': 279}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,849878.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,

I've been following this sub for a while now, and I’m really impressed by all those wonderful moneysaving tips I already got from all the posts I’ve seen.

This is my first post, and English is not my first language so don't roast me.

So, over the course of the last year I decided to get as packaging free as possible and avoid plastic. At first, I did this to do my part for saving the environment, but I discovered soon that this was a big money saver as well. There is a lot of ways to reach my goal so this post will focus on the bathroom.

So here is what I did:

Being 21F there is a lot of stuff and a lot of products I spent a lot of money on.

I bought **shampoo bars and a conditioner bar**. My first shampoo bars were around 9€, same price for the conditioner bar. I thought that was a high price, but they last incredible long. One shampoo bar lasts for around 4-6 months for me. I bought them at Lush, but recently discovered that my local cosmetics store offers some at the price of 5€. So, I basically get 3 shampoo bottles for 5€. What a deal. (I recently read an article about working conditions at Lush being bad in my country so I stopped buying them, but this is a good example in English)

There’s plenty of other stuff packaging free as well I have from them, such as hair wax etc.

Next step were products for my face. I bought a **facial soap** for the daily cleaning. I bought it November last year, and it lasts (being in daily use) until this day. Was around 10€ as well, but I think there’s also some cheaper options here.

My most recent steps were eliminating bodywash or shower gel and replacing them with soap. I bought a **nice soap** (its natural cosmetics) for around 1,50€ and **a soap saver bag** and I’m pretty sure it will last way longer than any of my bodywashes has before. Especially thinking about all those leftover drops of bodywash I couldn’t get out of the bottle. The soap saver bag will make sure that even if the soap crumbles I’ll get everything out of this soap bar and, it’s a nice peeling.

To reduce my costs on hair removal i recently bought a **2in1 epilator and razor device** (Mine is the Braun Silk Epil 9). It works absolutly great and I think will never have to buy razors or shaving foam again.

Last thing for the bathroom, I bought **reusable cleansing pads**. I use them and wash them with my clothes afterwards.

There are so many more fields I’m trying to avoid packaging and plastic, but I think I’ll stop here for today.

Have any of you found more ways of saving money for cosmetics and saving the environment? I’m curious to hear your ways!

EDIT: Removed the links for the examples. Most products mentioned can be found on amazon as well as your local cosmetics store.

EDIT: Added the part about razor and epilator.

I share an apartment with three students, and spend $250 a month on rent. Utilities can be anywhere from $50 to $100 a month. My phone plan costs $54. I have a little bit over 4K in savings right now, which I was only able to amass because I was living with my parents for awhile. I will owe around most likely about a grand in 1099 taxes in April. I don't have a car. 

What I DON'T want to happen is for myself to get down to the wire with money, be broke, and have to end up back on my parents' doorstep at 23. I am doing alright at present, and becoming a 30 year old basement dweller with my folks does not appeal to me. Credential wise, I have a high school diploma, an Associate's in general studies, and that's it. The prospect of going to college appeals to me, but loans do not. 

Is it even possible for someone in my position to make a profit / save a little on the side? I shop dirt cheap in terms of groceries. What are some tips I should have?

They start marking down a couple days before it expires, and it's usually at least half off the day before. I spotted a bunch of soon to expire meat for 25% off on Monday and waited it out until today. Today's haul, 4 packs of skirt steak for $20.61 instead of $48.46.  They are headed to the deep freezer. I see fajitas in my future.

EDIT 1: To the several of you no, not every grocery store does this. Many do, but a lot would rather toss food than give you a cheaper option.  


EDIT 2: No, it's not unsafe. Ever been to a fancy steakhouse with expensive ""aged"" beef?

About 10 years ago I bought a house in a desirable small town for $90k. $20k down, $70k 30y mortgage. About 1,100 sq ft. Commute is 15 minutes, it’s 10 minutes to the beach and 5 minutes to the train station. 

Now, the house needs windows and siding. I’ve refinanced to a $150k 30y mortgage and have almost $90k sitting in the bank. Problem is, that’s barely enough money to do the exterior stuff, and the kitchen and bathroom need updating too. And I’m going wild at the thought of being in debt up to my eyeballs for the rest of my life.

I’m seriously considering selling and then finding a very small house in a less desirable area for $60-$80k. Obviously, such a house will need some work and will require downsizing. But the idea of having something paid off is so alluring and the idea that I can then live more fully with the money I do have is tantalizing. 

The major downsides are possibly a 30 or 40 minute commute, dealing with a house that may be initially in poor condition, and living in an area that may be less safe and less cheerful (signs of poverty and junk aren’t uplifting). And I’m not sure my spouse will go for it.

My apartment’s AC is still going off despite my current efforts:
1. I keep the AC on 78F when I’m not home. I’ll keep it 78 until I either can’t stand it or until I’m ready for bed, then I turn it down to 76. I chose 78 because I read that’s the highest I can go without damaging my belongings. My living room fan helps a lot, but I can’t use my bedroom fan because I suffer from dry eyes.
2. I don’t have curtains, so I keep my blinds closed at all times. Unfortunately, the sun shines directly into my apartment when it’s setting. 4pm-7pm is the hottest part of the day for me. Would opening them at night help with cooling? The lows have been in the 50’s right now.

Second question- what are some great ways to reduce water heating? Here’s what I’m doing so far:
1. Taking short baths with less, more tepid water. I don’t run super hot showers either.
2. Using warm water instead of hot water for laundry

I don't drink alcohol. I don't smoke. I don't have a pet any more. I have one plant (that requires water only). I cut my own hair, don't own any nail varnish, don't have any beauty treatments. My flat is basically an empty shell, a bit like you took a vacant apartment and put a few things in it. My bathroom has: toothbrush, toothpaste, shower gel, flannel, towel, moisturiser. My clothes I could fit in a suitcase and I have two pairs of trainers. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful to have all of this. But after bills, there is barely enough money left for food. Nothing else. This morning I have just reached my limit.

I have run out of toilet roll after buying a thing from Wilko that I thought would last the entire month. I have little food in. I am just absoluteley sick of it. I reached my limit and posted to two assistance subs which was embarrassing aside from anything else and somehow messed that up probably because I am so stressed and they got deleted for not having the right title or something.

I don't spend money on anything but bills or food, it's like my life has been static for two years now. I had an accident, surgery, I lost a good job, now I live on what I can make, and live in pain. It is SO different from how my life used to be. I'm not saying I was earning tonnes of money but I was a research assistant at a university so it was above minimum wage and I could manage easily on it. Now I am buying yellow sticker food, going to shops at times things are reduced, and it's not that really, I can cope with that, it's how I've had to cut EVERYTHING else to the bone, so cutting my own hair, there is NO budget for leisure, anything for me, anything else at all. I have not been able to go anywhere for those two years, away, on holiday, a day trip, anything. I go and sit in a local park! I contacted citizen's advice about budgeting and they said it is not me, that my budget was unworkable but what do I do? If I claimed benefits I would get £300 a month to live on which is worse than what I earn. With the recent energy increased and almost all bills going up I'd guess most people's bills are over £300 a month and that's before food which has gone through the roof. I also owe one friend £200 and another £150 which I keep borrowing at the end of the month then paying back every single month and I want to get out of this cycle.

&#x200B;

TBH the increase in food prices is what has hit me the hardest. I am trying to gain weight as well, I cannot lose any more weight, I am underweight as it is. I would LOVE to buy Huel or something like that to supplement my food but I can't afford that. Everything has gone up. Baked beans were 33p they are now 55p. Cheese has gone up. Every single item in the supermarket now seems more expensive. I am just really fed up. I literally don't know how to cut corners any more, if anyone has any ideas let me know. I cannot grow my own food as no outdoor space, the allotments have a 3 yr waiting list and I doubt I would be able to manage it realistically because I struggle to walk.

Whenever someone comes to my house they’ll say how lovely it smells. Then they get a shock when I tell them what it is. They’re only cheap perfumes, nothing branded but they smell lovely and the smell lasts for ages when used as a perfume which gave me the idea. My work jacket was hanging in the living room and I could smell the perfume for days after so I decided to rescue the testers and put them to good use, something I’m very proud of.

However, research, consumer sentiment, analysts are able to show that Prime Day is more about getting users to sign up for Prime and marketing the brand, than it is about providing deals to existing customers.

I strongly recommend you use a historical price checker like CCC or Keepa to actually verify the prices are lower, as it is a common tactic to raise prices before a sale and then trick customers into feeling like they got a deal with a large % drop, like 50% off. Also keep in mind many sites will be pushing the event despite lackluster deals, because they want people to come to their site to see the aggregated 'deals' (getting ad revenue), and some of them will be linking to Amazon for that sweet affiliate money on anything you buy.

Here are the stats:

    Comparing black friday prices to Amazon day:
    BF Prices for Laptops were 5% cheaper
    BF Prices for Small Appliances were 3% cheaper
    BF Prices for Tablets were 7% cheaper
    BF Prices for TVs were 15% cheaper
    BF Prices for Video Games were 12%
    On average prices were 9% lower on BF than prime day.
    Of 450 best-sellers, only 43 were discounted 10% or more on primeday
    Adobe's social media tracker found 50% of shoppers were disappointed, 23% felt joy
    Last year, our staff scanned nearly 8,000 deals and found only 64 worth posting.

I was sitting in a work meeting and my boss said that Walmart was awful, then commented that they will do anything possible to avoid shopping there and Target was infinitely better. Then another coworker chimed in about the old website “People of Walmart”.

I used to shop at Target a lot but started realizing that I ended up wasting a ton of money on impulse buys. Their produce is also…not great. And they have limited food options in general.

The major chain grocery store down the street has been growing increasingly more expensive with every passing month. Eating mostly vegetarian should not cost more than $60 per week for two people and at Walmart, we are getting right around the $50 mark. We still spend more some weeks than others when we buy chicken from Costco, but on the whole, I actually feel like I’m paying what I should for eating beans, lentils and tuna each week.

My husband and I make decent money as we both have moderately high paying jobs, but we are currently saving for a new house and saving wherever we can. This means shopping at places with cheaper groceries/general staples and of course, limiting eating out.

After discovering their online shopping, we won’t even need to go in store anymore, which is great from a time saving perspective.

But for me, even though my parents are both very, very well off, we grew up shopping there. My parents had both lived through poverty and saw the value in continuing to live minimally in many ways but lavish in others (nice vacations, building a pool in the backyard, etc.)

At the end of the day, I also just want more money leftover to do what I want with.

 I make about $1200/month, and the same for my SO. We both live with parents (both 21 y/o) and each have about the same amount of bills (about $400/month each between everything)

I can save anywhere from between $500-700/month depending on how much I spend on gas that month.

How much is a decent amount for the actual wedding? What are some ""hidden"" costs associated with getting married that I should know about? The plan is to keep my/our debt level at >0.

Edit: I guess I should clarify, I'm looking for the best bang for my buck, not to be cheap. I'd rather not skip out on some important bits to save a couple dollars. I just want to be well prepared

Edit 2: The question of whether or not I'm going to get married in the first place is a non-issue. I've already made up my mind. I truly appreciate any advice though. I've heard the horror stories as well as the good ones.

My first post here but I wanted to share how I went from spending $600 (😳) a month to less than $200 a month on groceries for a family of 2. And I want to clarify - groceries here encompasses both food and household essentials (toilet paper, trash bags, soap, etc) I’m on mobile so apologies in advance for any formatting errors. Many of these tips you may already know but if you’re a newbie like me, all this blew my mind and may help you. 

1. Make a spreadsheet. This took the longest - I hunkered down on a Saturday and made a list of the most common 50 items I buy at a grocery store. I then created 4-6 separate columns for each. If you haven’t already checked it out, KrazyCouponLady has what they call a “stock up pile price list” for many common household items. They have prices for 3 & 6 months - if you see it for x price, stock up for 3 months. If you see it for y price, stock up for 6. They don’t recommend stocking up more than 6 months as things tend to go bad and unless you’re super on top of it, you’ll likely forget you have it and are likely to double purchase. Anyway, I added the 3 and 6 month prices to my spreadsheet, then each additional column is the lowest priced comparable item (I’m not comparing Charmin Ultra vs. 1 ply toilet paper - not a fair comparison) for each of my grocery stores. Here’s the key - GO BY PRICE PER POUND/UNIT/OUNCE. More often than not, Costco was cheaper than Walmart and Kroger for household items and some grocery items. Aldi consistently has the cheapest meat. However, some instances where Walmart was cheaper (heavy whipping cream and sour cream are two examples). Highlight the cheapest item for each of your stores and there’s your base. All in all, it took me about 3 hours but I never have to do it again and it’s already saved me hundreds of dollars. 

Editing to add because this question has come up a few times: Kroger and Walmart list their prices in the app and online. Costco and Aldi have price lists linked here. https://queenbeecoupons.com/costco-price-list-updated-with-600-per-unit-prices/?m

https://www.simplegrocerydeals.com/aldi-price-list/

It’s important to note prices will vary by region so I’d recommend keeping an up to date spreadsheet for your use and make notes of any discrepancies when you are out shopping. 

SECOND EDIT: I went ahead and made a shareable spreadsheet. Please note I live in north DFW so your pricing may vary but feel free to use as a starting point for yours - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zz17MCUGDRKTp86LQHFJh6NqTLNOmm9n8KTTrYMsUm8/edit?usp=sharing

2. Take inventory of what you have. Many people, myself included until I switched to this method, make a menu based on what they want to eat this week. They then go to the store and buy ingredients to make said items. Don’t do this. Take inventory of what you have on hand, because you likely can make meals out of that. What’s on its way out in the fridge? What’s already open in your pantry? Take inventory of everything, including your freezer, and literally google “ground beef rice beans dish” and go from there. If you’re not creative, the internet will take care of the rest. And for bonus points, if you make it and like it, save the recipe and start a recipe binder. 

3. For everything else, buy what’s on sale. If you take nothing else from this post except this one thing, download Flipp. It aggregates all your local grocer circulars into one app where you can make a grocery list and find the cheapest price for that item this week.  The items I have had to buy, are always on sale w the exception of things like produce. For February, I spent $180 on groceries which included a $70 Costco purchase of trash bags, charmin, clorox and more household essentials that were all on sale and some even lower than the 6 month stock up price list. Now that’s $70 I won’t have to spend for the next 6 months that can go back into buying other stuff on sale to make stock piles, buying more food with my budget, or just saving!

4. Lastly - utilize that freezer! If your budget permits, buy more than you can (within reason) and stock up. I bought 10 pounds of local ground beef on sale at Aldi that was marked down even more to $10 for 10 pounds. Did I need 10 pounds of ground beef that week? Nope! But for just a few more dollars than what I was planning on spending, I doubled my ground beef reserve and had a stock pile to make dishes for the entire month. Same thing w $2.99 chuck roast at Kroger or $0.79 chicken thighs. Out of $180, $70 was spent on meat that was on sale, $70 for household essentials, and the rest in filling in the items to make meals. 

I am so thankful to have found this way of living (I got most of my resources from Jordan Page and honestly don’t even remember how I stumbled onto her channel). In the $400 I saved this month, I applied it to my car payment and paid it off (I had less than $1000 on it and am now working on tackling the rest of my debt).",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,How I went from $600 to $200 a month for groceries on a family of 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/fcgoll/how_i_went_from_600_to_200_a_month_for_groceries/,all_ads,t3_fcgoll,3066,1.0,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'RW2DIrYIg0tS5aQZFbu-59xxQM2rloZVAr99ub7RGe4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/__ZVQrfOd8WmGI-inOsaG5AihMq2cHPThpnEwhAOrCw.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4166fdf133567008ec03a1a637cef23a62b0e03b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 288, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/__ZVQrfOd8WmGI-inOsaG5AihMq2cHPThpnEwhAOrCw.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d6c49c9e1b4c64da555a7ea1dea0e130ce16e8a1', 'width': 216}, {'height': 427, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/__ZVQrfOd8WmGI-inOsaG5AihMq2cHPThpnEwhAOrCw.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=20a802448a3517d5ae673e6917c961af6010d5f0', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 734, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/__ZVQrfOd8WmGI-inOsaG5AihMq2cHPThpnEwhAOrCw.jpg?auto=webp&s=f4e6f155f785d5a5b6d755b6c1bda8428d4916b8', 'width': 550}, 'variants': {}}]}",,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1238802.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,,,1529699878.0,t2_1mjbu5vy,0.0,"{'gid_1': 2, 'gid_3': 1}",1.0,0.0,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'coin_price': 1800, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 31, 'days_of_premium': 31, 'description': 'Gives the author a month of Reddit Premium, which includes %{coin_symbol}700 Coins for that month, and shows a Platinum Award.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/platinum_512.png', 'icon_width': 512, 'id': 'gid_3', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Platinum', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/platinum_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/platinum_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/platinum_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/platinum_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/platinum_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None}, {'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'coin_price': 100, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 2, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': ""Shows the Silver Award... and that's it."", 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'icon_width': 512, 'id': 'gid_1', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Silver', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None}]",3.0,1.0,,0.0,[],,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,

My wife and I currently pay $835/month for rent at an apartment + our regular bills. The lease expired this month and we can continue month to month with them for an extra $100 per month or we can renew the lease and keep paying $835. My mother in law told me today that she owns a mobile home that is on a friends piece of property. Her friend is selling her property and told my MIL to move her trailer or it will be taken to the dump. My MIL told us we can have the trailer and she has offered to let us put the trailer on her land. So we were offered a free trailer and a free piece of land to put it on. The only reason she hasn’t moved it here herself is that the trailer needs some fairly serious renovations... the flooring in it is new and he roof/walls are solid but other than that it’s fairly rough. Should my wife and I move this mobile home to her property and invest our money into fixing it up or should we say no thank you and keep Renting?
My father in law manages a business that mostly restores flooded homes (we live in Baton Rouge, LA), and he’s seen the mobile home and said it is definitely a fixer upper but can be done. He thinks it’s a good idea.
My parents think it’s a bad idea.
What do you guys think?


Edit for additional info: I’m currently a student and I’m applying for my universities Physical Therapy Assisting program. If I get accepted, I will not be able to work, since my class hours will be 8am-5pm mon-fri with studying after class. We will not be able to pay our bills (mainly rent) on my wife’s earnings alone, so we will have to take out loans (in addition to my tuition loans) just to pay our rent/pay for food etc.. My university will let me know in April if I’ve been accepted into the program, at which point I’ll have to start getting loans. I’m partially thinking about not going into the program this year even if I am accepted, that way I can save up 300-400 per month each month for the next year so that when I do get into the program, I have money set aside to help pay bills. My parents also think this is a very bad idea, they think I should take the loans out and get through school this year. 
I think this mobile home would
1) make it easier for me to save money over the next year
And

Edit #2: It seems that the most common “not worth it” tips are: Shopping at a warehouse club if there isn’t one near your location, driving farther for cheaper gas, buying cheap tires/shoes/mattresses/coffee/toilet paper, washing laundry with cold water, not owning a pet or having hobbies to save money, and reusing certain disposable products such as zip lock baggies.

I'm moving in with 3 other friends to a place in the middle of the city with $80AU rent per week (we are renting off a mate's parents) which is amazing value. 

My income/ expense details, if it helps- I make about $1100 per month, rent is $320, travel is $100, I won't be paying for utilities and I'm lucky enough that my mother will still keep paying for my phone and all internet I need I can get from uni. That leaves $680 per month for food/savings/social life/other. 

I don't have much in savings (about $300) and other than a ps3, a dresser and a bookcase I don't own any furniture. I don't move out until September so I have a little while to save up and find things. 

I'm not sure how to best prepare how to move out, or how to organise my spending once I move.

I&#39;m moving in with 3 other friends to a place in the middle of the city with $80AU rent per week (we are renting off a mate&#39;s parents) which is amazing value. </p>

<p>My income/ expense details, if it helps- I make about $1100 per month, rent is $320, travel is $100, I won&#39;t be paying for utilities and I&#39;m lucky enough that my mother will still keep paying for my phone and all internet I need I can get from uni. That leaves $680 per month for food/savings/social life/other. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have much in savings (about $300) and other than a ps3, a dresser and a bookcase I don&#39;t own any furniture. I don&#39;t move out until September so I have a little while to save up and find things. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how to best prepare how to move out, or how to organise my spending once I move. </p>

<p>Also I live in Australia where we seem to make more money than the US but goods and services tend to costs more. </p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

I’m stressing because not only did I really never expect to get married and have zero ideas on how to plan a wedding (and neither does my fiancée), I am pretty young, still in college and even planning a small wedding with close friends and family seems more stressful than fun when we are living paycheck to paycheck.

On the latest episode they had a small business owner talk about how food delivery apps (Doordash, GrubHub, Caviar, etc.) impact the bottom line of these mom-and-pop shops much more than the general public might think.

At the end, Evan made the comment that she has never used one of these servces and the business owner was quite shocked, saying ""You're probably in a very small fraction of people who has never used these apps.""

Really? Is this true? I've never used these apps or done anything other than order directly from a place to eat, whether it means calling them for pickup or standing in line to order. I can't imagine spending an extra $10+ to buy food that I could very easily go and order/pick up myself. If I don't have time or I'm too lazy to go out, then I just eat at home. 

For people who do use these services, I imagine they end up thinking ""where does all my money go?"" and then realize they have to cut back. Or maybe it's the group of people for whom an extra $5 here or $10 here really doesn't matter.

I hope you can get something useful out of it, but it can't possibly help everyone. Buying a house is an extremely complex process with thousands of variables. Please use your own critical thinking and judgment.***

Also: I am a failure in all things grammar and spelling related. Please contact me with errors so I can fix them. I have learned that some people get **really** upset about it. 

My home cost me a little over $63K (almost $6000 went to expenses like inspections and closing cost!) and I rent it for $950 per month. It is a three bed one bath ( 970ft^2 ) with a large fenced yard and carport. It is located in the greater New Orleans area.


***Step One***

Figure out where you want to live, and what housing requirements you need. (beds/baths/garage etc.) I have read that if you don't stay in a house for around five years its cheaper to rent, but I can't confirm anything. 

**WHAT I DID:** My requirements were to find a good rent house, that I could also live in if the need came up. I knew I wanted to get a three bedroom place, because it would attract the most stable renters, people with children. I also wanted to have a laundry room, carport/garage, and a fenced yard. 


***Step Two***

So you know where you want to live, and you know what you need. Great. Can you afford it? I waited to buy my house until I had saved up about 30% of the total cost of the house. This allowed me to have cash on hand for: Inspections, utility fees, down payment, and unexpected expenses (which I ran into). 

**WHAT I DID:** My income was sitting at $50k a year when I started this project, and I knew I would need to find a place that I could make the numbers work on. My PRIMARY goal was to find the LEAST expensive house I could turn into a good rental and would still be decent to live in if I had to move there. I needed the total cost of the house to be able to be returned by income from the rental in eight years (figuring ten months income per year). I also needed my monthly payment to sit at less than 50% of the monthly income of the unit. Where I went wrong was forgetting to get quotes for insurance early enough. ***I'm lucky I found one cheap provider otherwise my whole plan would have tanked.***, I didn't realize how expensive that stuff is. I can't stress this enough, my monthly insurance payment is BIGGER than my monthly mortgage payment. I also want to talk about equity. Its important to find a house that will have positive equity after your finished buying/fixing it. After I finished the process my house had about 18k in real borrowing equity. 


***Step Three***

Look for a house. There are many super tools on the net, and my favorite is this one:

BUT I also searched the paper, CL, ALL my local realtors, the local sheriffs sale, and the best of all was driving around looking for ""for sale by owner"" signs. Get out and talk to people, you never know. 

**WHAT I DID:** I bought one house (relatives house) at the sheriffs sale (bank repo's, tax repos), but wouldn't recommend it. In my particular county I went five times to the sheriffs auction, and I was the only person to buy a house out of all five times. Many people bid, but the banks send lawyers to outbid you. I bought one house by finding a ""for sale by owner"" (relatives house) sign and calling, and I bought ***MY*** house by finding it at the website above. I was specifically looking for something that was close to move in condition, but needed some work and was located close to my own home. So.........I looked, and I looked, and I looked. It took me eight months to locate the home that I finally bought. I had put in offers on other places, but they didn't pan out. My place is on a quiet, dead end, mixed race street. Some white, some black, and some Hispanic. Almost all home owners, almost all with children. I want to stress that I was a maniac about searching. Everyday I would look over ever source again and again. I was relentless in my pursuit. 


***Step Four***

Secure financing. Go to your preferred financial institution and apply for a home loan. When you are approved you will get a ""Pre-approval letter"", with this document you can now put offers in on most homes. 

**WHAT I DID:** I worked with a small local bank because my CU doesn't do loans on houses that need work. (203k, construction loans) I am not sure this is the cheapest way to get financing and would love to read how other people saved money by cutting middle-men etc. 


***Step Five***

Find your realtor. 

**WHAT I DID:** I called around to all the major realtor offices and asked for a bank repo specialist. After too many calls I finally got in touch with my guy. He was intimidating, and has a lisp, and I didn't like him at all to begin with. BUT, he turned out to be damn good at his job and pretty cool too.


***Step Six***

Go look at the house. I looked at DOZENS of properties before I found the right one. If you are looking at a fixer upper bring: writing material, tape measure, torpedo level, flashlight, and step ladder. Or if you are not handy or have no idea what repair work will cost, bring a contractor or friend who does. Be thorough in your investigation, if the place has water and electric turned on test all the drains/lights/switches. Look for termites, water damage, recent work that may be covering problems, search in the attic, check EVERYTHING and bring a camera/camcorder to take pics and video. It will be helpful later. Talk to the neighbors, I knocked on doors. I asked questions like ""hows the neighborhood?"", ""do you know the people who used to live here?"", and ""do you know if they had problems with the house?"". You'll be surprised, I got tons of good info from knocking on doors.  

**WHAT I DID:** I'm kinda handy (because I had two houses under my belt) and checked everything myself on the first visit. My house had no electric or water (repo), so I couldn't test anything. MORE ON THIS LATER. The walls had a few small holes in them, the trim was not painted. The floor was laminate and dirty carpet. The colors of paint were ugly pink and dark blue. She didn't look very appealing. BUT the roof was new, the kitchen and bathroom were new, the doors were all in good shape, and the foundation was sound. While she wasn't much to look at she had potential. I ended up putting ceramic tile in the whole house, and painting the whole house a nice antique white. She looks very nice now. Buying it in poor superficial condition saved me a TON of money. I suggest looking for a home with a strong back and an ugly face. You can put a new face on it for way less than the discount you will receive. 

***Step Seven***

***IF*** the numbers work (how much to fix, how much to buy, monthly payment, estimated tax and insurance, (you need to pay the first years insurance at closing! ouch.), blah blah blah) put in your offer. I can't really recommend too much on this, but this is how I did it:

**WHAT I DID:** On all the houses I put offers in on, I would deduct the repair cost from the asking price, then slash that by 20%, and that would be my offer. As you can imagine, I had a lot of offers that got no response. Which means the seller thought it was so low they didn't even bother to counter. That's fine with me. I needed the house with the numbers that worked. Eventually I found a HUD repo (my realtor said they are the worst of the worst!) that had an asking price of $49,900. I offered $40,00, they countered with $49k, I countered with $42k, they countered at $48k, I countered with $43k, and they got pissed at all the counters and told my realtor that they would take $46,500 bottom dollar. I ***countered*** at $46550, and they would have to pay $1500 in closing cost. They accepted. So After everything was said an done, I bought the house for $45,050. 

***Step Eight***

Your offer was ACCEPTED, now you will do a contract with the seller, and make a good faith deposit. 

**WHAT I DID:** When your offer is accepted and your making the contract, you can add clauses. One of mine was that I would receive my good faith deposit back if I could not secure financing. Talk to your realtor about this.

**Rest in comment below**",,False,,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,,,self,,,"How to buy a house on the cheap, a ""how to"", from r3dstorm.",http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/p6df8/how_to_buy_a_house_on_the_cheap_a_how_to_from/,,t3_p6df8,279,1.0,,,,,,,0.0,1328118458.0,95.0,,,0.0,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong><em>This is only a guide, and it only fits my needs and situation. I hope you can get something useful out of it, but it can&#39;t possibly help everyone. Buying a house is an extremely complex process with thousands of variables. Please use your own critical thinking and judgment.</em></strong></p>

<p>Also: I am a failure in all things grammar and spelling related. Please contact me with errors so I can fix them. I have learned that some people get <strong>really</strong> upset about it. </p>

<p>My home cost me a little over $63K (almost $6000 went to expenses like inspections and closing cost!) and I rent it for $950 per month. It is a three bed one bath ( 970ft<sup>2</sup> ) with a large fenced yard and carport. It is located in the greater New Orleans area.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step One</em></strong></p>

<p>Figure out where you want to live, and what housing requirements you need. (beds/baths/garage etc.) I have read that if you don&#39;t stay in a house for around five years its cheaper to rent, but I can&#39;t confirm anything. </p>

<p><strong>WHAT I DID:</strong> My requirements were to find a good rent house, that I could also live in if the need came up. I knew I wanted to get a three bedroom place, because it would attract the most stable renters, people with children. I also wanted to have a laundry room, carport/garage, and a fenced yard. </p>

<p><strong><em>Step Two</em></strong></p>

<p>So you know where you want to live, and you know what you need. Great. Can you afford it? I waited to buy my house until I had saved up about 30% of the total cost of the house. This allowed me to have cash on hand for: Inspections, utility fees, down payment, and unexpected expenses (which I ran into). </p>

<p><strong>WHAT I DID:</strong> My income was sitting at $50k a year when I started this project, and I knew I would need to find a place that I could make the numbers work on. My PRIMARY goal was to find the LEAST expensive house I could turn into a good rental and would still be decent to live in if I had to move there. I needed the total cost of the house to be able to be returned by income from the rental in eight years (figuring ten months income per year). I also needed my monthly payment to sit at less than 50% of the monthly income of the unit. Where I went wrong was forgetting to get quotes for insurance early enough. <strong><em>I&#39;m lucky I found one cheap provider otherwise my whole plan would have tanked.</em></strong>, I didn&#39;t realize how expensive that stuff is. I can&#39;t stress this enough, my monthly insurance payment is BIGGER than my monthly mortgage payment. I also want to talk about equity. Its important to find a house that will have positive equity after your finished buying/fixing it. After I finished the process my house had about 18k in real borrowing equity. </p>

The only thing we really spend more than we should on is food because that's the one indulgence we allow ourselves to keep us sane. 

I try to use everything frugally not just because we're broke but I'm just a cheap person..i don't like to buy unnecessary amounts of things if can save and reuse the old things instead. 

My SO and i have been living together for over a year and his use of household items has always been an issue for me. We spend excess amounts on things like toilet paper and paper towels because he seems to think it takes half a roll of either to do anything. I've finally accepted that since we live cheaply in other places, i can accept that he wastes those items because after all, I'm sure i waste certain items that bothers him too. 

Yesterday, however, he got raw meat out of a ziplock bag and put it on top of the ziplock bag then got a new ziplock bag out to put the leftover meat in because the old bag was now dirty. And it really bothered me, why not use a plate that we can wash for the raw meat and use the same bag instead of wasting? (This doesn't happen occasionally, it is often because we eat a LOT of meat with him being diabetic.)

Has anyone been in the same situation and how did you get over it? I'm less worried about the money that is wasted and more annoyed with myself that i immediately snap at him. Was there a way you got through to someone to quit being wasteful? Is there something you tell yourself so you just ""get over it""?

Tl;dr - my SO is wasteful of household products and i want to find away to get over it and not snap at him. We're frugal in so many places that logically this one doesn't bother me but i still get irritated by it. 

Edit: i want to clarify my toilet paper problem. I have no issue with the amount he uses on his bottom. Its the amount he uses to blow his nose or the half a roll he uses to clean up the sink after shaving his beard. Or the amount he uses to clean his glasses.

As the title suggest, I went through my budget and was surprised to see I really underspent on my groceries and wanted to share some things we did that might be helpful. This will be a long post but hopefully it helps someone, I only just learned how to cook this past year and used this sub to help me, so hopefully I’m able to pay it forward since some of the things I learned I haven’t seen mentioned here. Some things to get out of the way before the tips:

* This is strictly groceries, not eating out, or household maintenance no pots/pans, cleaning supplies, paper towels, coffee filters etc etc strictly food we consume
* I am the main decision maker when it comes to the kitchen, I pay for about %75 of groceries, my SO pitches in for smaller grocery runs (under $25) so the average is probably $200 a month, still way below the standard $300 for household of 2 adults
* We’re both 30, both work full time, no kids and combined make probably just over $130k in a fairly big city (MCOL) in the NE USA
* We share about %90 of the food we eat. Nothing exclusive to one another except a few random things ex. I drink almond milk, my SO drinks whole milk and some other small differences.
* We are NOT foodies, and we are NOT great cooks. This is my first year actually learning to cook. And it’s the reason we wanted to keep our grocery budget low, since we value everything else in our budget more than food, so as long as it’s nutritious and at least decent to eat, we’re happy :)

Last thing I wanted to share was some life events that impacted our budget, we relocated to this new city Dec 2021, so the first few months of the year I was still building out my pantry, which was an added expense. Then this past September I got a work from home position, so far my budget has not been influenced too much by it but only time will tell.

Okay time for tips:

\-**Most likely what you grew up eating, will be the cheapest thing for you to cook.** Whether you’re hispanic, asian, american, european…you have familiarity with the flavors and your pantry is probably already geared towards that pallet bringing the cost per meal way lower. For instance, I’m hispanic and I know off the top of my head 10 different rice recipes just because I grew up eating them, even if some of them I can’t cook just yet, I know how they’re suppose to taste and what’s involved in it. Give me a potato and I only know how to boil it. Maybe I’ll add it to one of my hispanic dishes, but guess what? I’m still cooking rice to go with it. Speaking about cost per meal, I quickly realized how expensive it was to branch to diff food profiles, I wanted to learn how to cook more asian dishes and kinda had to stop haha, I had no room in my small kitchen for all the additional spices and noodles needed. I settled with some of the basic condiments (sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce and kewpie lol) incase I want to venture off a bit, again a lot of these asian meals also involved rice. Leading me to my biggest point.

\-**Stick to one carb and run with it**, I rarely cook with potatoes, bread or pasta, my go-to carb is rice (no surprise). I know a lot of people complain about just eating rice and beans to be frugal. But take for instance, if you love potatoes, there’s literally hundreds of different ways to make potatoes interesting, seriously you really can’t get bored of something you *like* to eat. I think that’s the key. I do keep a box of spaghetti handy, and my bf buys bagels for his breakfast, and every once in a while I’ll venture into other things but 80% of the time we’re eating rice and beans (with a salad and a protein).

\-**We buy the same protein every two weeks.** We buy chicken breast (more on that later), pork-chop (sometimes bone it sometimes not), ground beef (80/20) and shrimp. Every two weeks we run out of them, and we buy them again. If one gets too expensive, we buy an alternative (like ground turkey, or tilapia or chicken strips, whatever is available or cheapest) or we’ll just go w/o one of the protein and maybe just do a veggie dish or stretch out whatever we already have. Eggs we buy about once a month, we only cook them on our off days.

\-**We almost never buy pre-made meals**, in the beginning I would buy frozen dinners for work and that’s included in this budget. But I would keep them at my work fridge, at home we just cook, eat leftovers or eat out before getting home. Now that I’m working from home, and have a bit more time I do want to learn how to make corn bread and banana bread since we do buy those for quick breakfast and those are easy enough to bake with fairly simple ingredients. I’m also learning how to cut a whole chicken so again I can make stock and learn how to cook more than just chicken breast (idk if I’ll success but we’ll see!).

\-**We always buy fruit and vegetables**, again we’re creatures of habit. We usually buy the same thing: romaine lettuce, tomatoes, baby carrots, and onion. And in the fruit department we rotate a bit more but we usually always have: apples, tangerine and blueberries (currently we also have kiwi and bananas, yum!). We use the veggies for salad with every meal but also for me to seasoning and we add the fruits to our oatmeal in the morning (yep we buy steel cut oats and just cook it stove top in the morning).

\-**We shop around a lot**. We do most of our groceries at Aldi (about %80). We also go to our local H-Mart and we just found a nearby Trader Joes near us, those are all our cheap options. We do a ShopRite or Walmart run every once in a while for some specific things. Lastly we do have a Costco membership where we do stock up on dry goods (for instance a 24pck of box almost milk, or 25pds of jasmine rice), but we mostly use Costco for clothes, appliances and household essentials, it does add up in savings even for just the two of us.

\-**I season in bulk and rotate!** So for instance, if have ground beef, I usually season the whole thing with my basic seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, Goya), leave half out and freeze the other Half. I can make this weeks ground beef Spanish style with tomatoes, olives, cappers, peppers, cilantro etc and then, next week defrost the remainder and stir fry it with ginger, soy sauce, green onions and carrots. One base seasoning, two different approaches. Same with beans, I boil a pound of dry beans, season it all in a big pot, and divy up what I'll do with it and freeze the rest. Now I only cook about 2-3 time a week, If I’m tired, I know my beef is seasoned and can throw it in the pot, and I can just defrost some beans and put my rice cooker on and have dinner ready in 25min.

\-**Keep a notepad on the fridge with a running list for when things run out**, I know its common knowledge to always have a shopping list, but it really does work and help curve additional spending!

\-**If we can't eat it in a week, we freeze it.** Like just the most random things, you’d be surprise you can freeze. I for instance always freeze my cilantro, parsley and green peppers. Like I mentioned I usually freeze my rice and beans. My boyfriend always freezes hotdogs and bread. Also if there’s a can I didn’t finish off, like of tomatoes paste, I just chuck it in the freezer and next time I need it I run through hot water for a few minutes.

\-**Have an** **Emergency Meal ( a ""911"" like my mom used to call it)**. This is the “I don’t want to lift a finger” meal or the “our fridge is bare but we’re not off until tomorrow to grocery shop” meal. For us it's frozen french fries and frozen jamaican patties, its the only exception to pre-made meal we buy,  we really have gotten into a groove of cooking regularly so it, we only prepare it about 2-3 times a month.

Again, these are things I had to learn by trial and error, some may be obvious to the general public, but as someone who just learned to cook, it really wasn’t that obvious to me. Yes we probably had the money to be more liberal with our groceries, but 1.

I only marinated for about 4 hrs. Not long enough by far is how I feel. Also, it took me a lot longer than 12 hrs to dry the beef out. More like 16 with my fan and air filters.

Even after 18 or so hours, not all of the beef was dried. I can't explain why some of it wasn't, but some were definitely a little too thick, even though they were only like 3/8 of an inch thick. That was annoying to say the least. 

In the future, I will definitely just buy a dehydrator, or make a dehydrator myself using racks and some sort of heat element and my fan in combination.

DAMN YOU ALTON BROWN!


OP: I thought some folks might actually be interested in it. I saw a link on here a few weeks ago about it, and i literally was eating store-bought beef jerky as I read it. So i figured I'd just go for it, and if it works out, I will never have to buy store-bought jerky again!

So here's my investments for anyone interested:

$16 - 20"" Lasko brand box fan at Lowes

$8 - 3pack of 20""x20"" Energy Aire brand air filters - these don't look like they will be giving off much fuzzy, and I don't think they are fiberglass, which is good because I don't want to end up eating fiberglass splinters. they also had a 3pack of some eco-friendly air filter that was only 3 or 4 bucks, but it was fiberglass and it didn't have ridges, so i spent the extra couple bucks for convenience. oops.

$6 - 2 bungee cords, since I didn't have any. I could have bought a cheaper 2pack for 4 bucks, but they looked like cheapos and I actually use bungee cords for things other than making beef jerky.

$8 - just under 2lbs of ""Chuck Tender Roast"" at 4.18 a pound. I went in wanting flank steak, but that shit was like 8 bucks a pound and there is no way in hell i am spending that much. i'd rather just buy it already made if I wanted to spend that kind of money.

FREE - misc ingredients from my mother's refrigerator to make the marinade FREE - plastic bags to marinade and freeze in. FREE - electricity, since I live in a residence hall on campus at a university and I don't pay electric.

Total: $38 dollars for everything besides the stuff for the marinade. and since $8 was for the beef, $30 dollars of that investment can be reused over and over. the only thing I'm worried about is the filters, but if I run em through hot water for a while I'm sure there isn't much to worry about germ-wise. 

and now I just have to make it! soo damn excited. can't wait until it is frozen enough for me to cut it easily. it better be good too, because I just blew 38 bucks on this stuff. but at least I can use everything again and not have to buy it! and now I'm set up to where I just need to buy beef in order to make more! and will update when It's done tomorrow.

Currently I drive an 04 Hyundai Accent which gets below avg fuel economy for a subcompact, and which is basically just a point A to point B vehicle. It's got 165k miles on it and every few months it feels like I'm giving it more parts to slowly build it from the ground up, basically I'm done with it and am ready to move on when something big goes. 

Normally I've been the sort of person who mostly only cares if a car gets me from point a to point b as cheaply as possible, but I'm growing sick of that, and now want a car that offers a certain level of amenities to make my trips enjoyable. This is where I could use some r/frugal advice, as I am seeing few if any options that check my boxes, below are the list of must haves and optionals

1) Must get over 30mpg combined, the higher the fuel economy the better 
2) Must have 40k miles or less and be 5 years old or newer, and I'm aiming for 8k out the door after fees/trading in my old car.
3) Automatic transmission is a must though probably goes without saying
4) Must have push button start with keyless entry on the door handle, no pushing key fob buttons or manual keys.
5) Must have climate control (I'm so sick of constantly adjusting the levels in my car and never being comfortable)
6) Must have Android auto
7) Must have Bluetooth and steering where controls for that and volume and such


Optional:
1) backup camera, would be nice but not necessary.
2) fancy self driving features like lane detect, automatic braking, etc. I realize this is highly unlikely though and it's definitely not a requirement.


So far the only car that seems to come close to this would be an SE trim Mitsubishi Mirage from 2017 or newer. Some areas have them as low as 8k too, by me it's 10k for them usually, but I'm hoping over the next 1-2 years prices drop and there's still some reasonably low mileage options out there.

We're looking to do the legal deed separate from the personal ceremony, so whatever is cheapest is what we're looking for. 

How much does it cost to arrange a minister to ordain a wedding? Or what would be our other options? We aren't religious but are willing to work with a church.

I don't think it's fair to take up so much of her time, though, so I'm looking into getting a car of my own.

1.  I'm concerned about the reliability of used cars, especially high-mileage ones.  Of course, I'd get a carfax report and inspection before making an offer, but that doesn't guarantee that something won't go wrong a week later, leaving me with a huge repair bill.

2.  I'm just as concerned about spending $15k on a new car.  I *really* like the idea of having a warranty to last me all the way through college, but as I'm not able to work during school (tried it years ago, grades tanked), that's an awful lot of interest to compound.  On the other hand, I have to borrow ~$70k for the next three years' tuition/room&board/etc anyway, so another $15k might not make that big of a difference.

3.  Leasing offers a good compromise between the cost of a used car and the reliability of a new one, but I'm left with nothing at the end of the term.  Not a big fan of that, but I'd be willing to accept it if it's the soundest decision.


**So, what would you recommend?**  I'd appreciate any advice, both regarding the used/new/lease question, and specifically, what make/model to get.

Everyone has different things they splurge on, for me its tires, a nice jacket, kitchenware and the the four things mentioned above, but honestly anything that relates to your health should be a priority financially, food, hygienic's, and fitness are not something to skimp out on. (Although I personally do calisthenics which keeps my fitness cheap, I only pay for a pull-up bar)

Reason why I felt the need to mention this is because have many friends who claim to be ""frugal"" but really just buy cheap food, toiletries/skincare products go for daily 15 minute walks but then show me their new pair of Jordan 1's and say its worth it because its their hobby.

&nbsp;

It was a 2003 Honda Civic with about 200,000 miles on it for about $14,000 and 6.40% APR.  Currently there's about $10,000 left on it, a few bumps in the front, the engine line constantly coming back on, and pretty bad breaks.

&nbsp;

It's pretty much un-sellable.  
However my mom recently bought a 2015 Honda CR-Z and decided it wasn't for her and wants to give it to me.

&nbsp;

Obviously, the problem is, I can't afford both car payments (Civic is 250$ a month, CR-Z almost 300$).  

&nbsp;

Right now we're just going with the... well, guess this is impossible, and she's going to try and sell the CR-Z and buy something else while I keep what I have and move on. (Though she still wants me to plan to get a new car eventually b/e this car wont last me more than one or two more winters, duno if it'll last this current one either).

How it is possible to afford new glasses with a new prescription every year? Is it, especially when a yearly supply of contacts cost \~$400 and you don't have vision insurance?

Do you just buy cheap frames, or do you completely switch to contact lenses and use old frames when you need to? Or do you just not get a new prescription or pair of glasses every year? At the same time, I'd prefer not to strain my eyes and accelerate the deterioration of my vision by continually using glasses from an old prescription. 

My home is also wondering how to prevent a possible intake of new glasses each year, haha, but I suppose I should just learn how to live and work with contacts, in spite of how much they strain my eyes when I use the computer.

- I've found a free event page on Facebook where various concerts and exhibitions are listed. For example, in the week before Easter, I attended two classical music concerts free of charge, one of which was Mozart’s Requiem, and it was amazing!

- I've started combining socializing with training. This way, I can get fitter, chat with my friends, and have fun all at the same time. Otherwise, we would probably meet at a cafe, which means paying for both training and cafe expenses.

- I've also joined friends group for mending, sewing, and handcrafting. We gather regularly, about once every three weeks, for a girls' handcraft night. We socialize and do some mending, and it feels very nice.

No way am I sinking that much money into this old thing.""

It feels wrong to put so much money into something that doesn't have much resale value left in it, but in many (possibly most) cases, it is definitely worth it.

The reason is that the resale value doesn't matter until you actually sell it. Instead, think about your vehicle in terms of cost per mile or month.

**Your old car, unless it needs regular expensive repairs, most likely costs you less per month than a newer car.** A newer car will generally save you a bit in MPG and will need fewer repairs, but the hit to your monthly budget is higher due to loan payments, interest, and higher insurance/taxes. Once your car is paid off, the out-of-pocket cost per month drops way off; ideally you should be setting aside the amount of your loan payment for your next vehicle, but you can also use it for repairs since they're helping you delay a new vehicle. For each repair that comes up, ask yourself ""how many months will this repair extend the useful life of my vehicle?"" You can't predict the future, but you do know the maintenance and repair history. If a repair is $600 and it gives you an extra year of use, then it costs $50 per month; that amount, together with other repair costs, should be less than the operating cost of a replacement car. If it's not, junk it.

Replacing your crappy car that's broken with similarly crappy car that's not (currently) broken can be problematic: you don't know that vehicle's repair and maintenance history, and they're selling that car for a reason. The car you purchase to replace your junked vehicle could be due for major repairs soon.

**The point of this post is not to say that you should always repair your crappy old car instead of replacing it.** It is this: the normal reaction to a big repair bill is to just get rid of it and buy something else. But that something else usually comes with significant cost or significant risk (unknown repair/maint history). So **do the math for your specific situation**, consider your risks, and make a decision based on numbers and acceptable risk rather than your gut reaction.

The longer you own a vehicle, the more months the fixed costs can be divided among *and* the slower its resale value depreciates. Also, that $600 repair means that when you do actually sell your vehicle, it will be worth $500 instead of $50.

Side tip: don't waste money on full coverage insurance once your vehicle's replacement value is low enough that you could handle the financial hit if your vehicle is totaled. You still need liability coverage, but you can take the money you were paying toward insurance and set it aside toward vehicle replacement if you do get in an accident. For example, your insurance will only pay a maximum of your vehicle's replacement value minus the deductible. Do the math and figure out how many months paying premiums it would take to reach that value. If it's only 10 months and you're a safe enough driver than you can generally go 10 months without totaling your car, then pay the premium amount to your own special savings account to be used only for covering accident costs.",,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,,,self,,,"LPT: Even when a repair costs more than your vehicle is worth, it can still be worth it to repair it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/5i4w1p/lpt_even_when_a_repair_costs_more_than_your/,,t3_5i4w1p,2059,1.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,

So we all know that bread machines are great. They make cheap bread (I calculated $0.60 a loaf), you can customize, make it warm, fresh, and delicious, and of course use it to mix and proof dough for other reasons (pizza, etc).

Well, I have never...and I mean NEVER...been to a thrift shop where there wasn't a bread maker for sale for $5-10. This is no exaggeration. Married couples always throw these on the registry, and then realize it takes up too much room in their house, so it's the first thing that gets donated. 

Just make sure the baking pan is in there before you buy, as this may be missing. 

Bread machines are amazing. 

(side note - proofing. So any yeast-based baked good you make, whether it be bread, croissants, some biscuits, or pizza, requires a period of time where it's placed in a warm environment to let the yeast eat the sugar and make CO2, thus leavening the dough. You can do this with a heating register and a covered bowl, a sunny window and a covered bowl, or more easily and reliably: a bread machine. Most have a ""proof only"" function that will proof your dough so you can bake it in a conventional oven).

After serving 3-4 years in the Army for the benefits of the G.I. bill (which I will immediately utilize for free housing, tuition and books) and getting basic/advanced EMT training and an associate's/bachelor's degree in Fire Science, I will move in with my older bro. In the worst case scenario that I manage to not get hired to work as a paid firefighter, I will work part-time just like my older bro.

In New York his small ass apartment that he's shared with roommates has a rent of $850. Not sure about cost of other bills. He lives near a library within walking distance which can be used for wifi, so let's assume we don't need a wifi bill. He has a metro card that he uses to take the train to work.

So here's what we've both been thinking lately; since he's too poor to invest even 10/15% of his pay into savings and doesn't have a 401k, I could move in with him. We could move somewhere else in the world that has significantly lower rent and with similar living conditions. We'll split money on rent and other bills 50/50, both work part time jobs, and then whenever we have the time, learn a skill or a trade and then work full time. Or if we're good enough as it is living part time, then we'll do just that, and then both invest a good portion of money into savings (I'd say in the 25-40% range) if we have to in order to spend on a good TV, a gaming system or a gaming PC or two, and whatever the hell else we want or feel like getting.

We're both still gonna live in the shithole apartment which honestly isn't bad for neither him or me. Hell, we wouldn't even need a bed to sleep on. Just a mattress and/or a couch along with a few pillows. All that would really be needed are the bare basics (kitchen, one bathroom, washing machine and dryer, a dinner table, two desks and two chairs) and enough space to do various bodyweight exercises such as push-ups and sit-ups which we'll use to maintain our health.

We'll even buy workout equipment such as dumbbells/barbells and a pull-up bar once we save enough.

Anyway, this is ultimately the plan my brother and I have been thinking. We don't give a shit about living conditions, if we're alive and healthy that's all that's even worth a damn to us.

Start looking at the backs of cars and seeing which dealership stickers you see the most. Ask friends and family who have bought cars. A dealership does not get a good or bad reputation by accident.

2) Don't be a total prick. Eventually down the road you will probably need something from your salesmen. If you were a prick to me I will not show you very good service. Case in point: today I had a customer that was very nice to me come in to have a part installed. Our parts department messed up the order and he got delayed about a month. So when he came in today I filled up his tank for free. If he had been a prick I wouldn't have given him more than 2 minutes of my time- much less a fill up. I also gave him a free oil change. Part of these things come out of my pocket so I am basically just doing something nice to repay his kindness.

3) Be informed. Know what you are buying. New or used. New: know rebates and try to do fair research on the kinds of markups they have. every dealer has different markups so try to give a relative idea. Used: Look up KBB.com. See what the book is for it (trade in). Know that they PROBABLY paid something around that for it. Add $500 to that and that is a fair price to buy it for.

4)Credit unions. They are good if 1) you are buying a used car or 2) you have little or bad credit. When buying new, if you have good credit, credit unions cannot touch dealer financing.

5) Ask what your interest rate is. Have an interest rate calculator. Make sure the payments are on par. Use your calculator and subtract 2 points from the rate if it is above a 5% interest. This is the rate you are shooting for. Tell them you want a lower payment without extending months. They can usually work to get a lower rate.

6) Try to bargain for fill ups and oil changes/ service contracts. They do not take too much from the salesmen's pockets so they are more apt to giving them out.

7) Always ask for a Carfax for a used car. If they will not give you one do not do business there.

8) There are many benefits to trading- such as saving time, effort, letting someone you do not know drive YOUR car, and you save tax rebates on the amount of your vehicle. 90% of people that I do business trade in their vehicle. It is just easier. For your trade look up KBB.com trade in value of it. If your car has less than 20k miles it is excellent, under 80k good, and anything over is fair. Account for tire replacement and dent repair. If they try to give you a different number than KBB ask to see the book. Book value is usually fair and it is what they have to go by.

9) Always be nice. We work a job just like you do. The second most people start talking to us they look at us as the enemy. That turns you into a hardened bastard after a while. Being considerate to us goes a very long way- at least to me. Remember that we too have to make a profit- but a fair one. I like to take care of my family just like you do.

10) If financing get GAP insurance. It should cost around 400 dollars. Let's say you owe $20,000 on a car and you wreck it. Insurance says it is worth $12,000. Without GAP you are $8,000 fucked. Gap insurance pays that $8,000. I have seen guys leave our dealership totally fucked cause they did not want to pay that one time fee that adds a couple bucks to a payment. It is well worth it!


Edit: reading some of your comments is kind of insulting. I know our profession has a bad rap but I was however trying to share helpful tips on how to get the best deal. In turn I've been called some pretty nasty things. To be honest- this is why a lot of car salesmen hate customers more than you all hate us. We are just trying to make a living to provide for our families. Unless you know more than speculation on the ins and outs of this business saying I am a liar, dirty car salesman is just bullshit. The GAP thing came up a lot. It is called INSURANCE for a reason. It is good if you need it. It is damn good. I will put it on my car when I buy one. I do not want to pay for negative equity when I wreck it and total it out- for a car I cannot drive any more- because I was being cheap when I did my paperwork. When we have customers come in and ask for it specifically- it is a good thing.

Some say it is worth it only if you enjoy it as a hobby. That may be the case but I want to share my experience specifically with making pizza.

Before making my own, my family and I would order it once a week from the local place. We make our own dinner every night of the week except the Friday or Saturday night when we got pizza. A 12 cut square pizza at this place is 13 bucks plus 2.25 for each additional topping. We decided extra cheese was worth it, and many times we would order chicken wings as well. All together it was about 30 dollars with tax.
Step in bread making. After some time I tried to make my own pizza crust because the dough from the grocery store, while cheap, just wasn't that good.

For reference I am using the overnight pizza dough with poolish from the book Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast. Im sure there are other good recipes out there. For an equivalent pizza to the one I would order at the pizza place:

**Crust:** $0.60. I buy 50 lb sacks of king Arthur special patent flour for about $15 at restaurant Depot, so $0.30 per lb. I also mix in whole grain rye for flavor. Salt and yeast are probably only a few cents. I get yeast and sea salt from BJ's for a good price.

**Sauce:** $0.50. I get crushed tomatoes for $0.65 per 28 oz can. I use about 390 grams per pizza. Considering the other ingredients and a freezer bag because I make it in bulk.

**Cheese:** $2.00. I use shredded mozzarella from restaurant Depot. I think it tastes better than grocery store stuff. I don't use a whole pound but it makes the math easier.

**Toppings:** $2.00. I like to load it up with onion and a meat, but veggies are really quite cheap and you don't need a ton of meat to cover this pizza.

So material wise it's $5.00. If you can't get the bulk discounts then it might be $7.00.  Add another $1.00 for the energy needed to make the pizza. With some effort you can have a quality pizza for less than **$10**.

Because we get to put on good toppings we don't feel the need to do wings. All in all I save probably $20 per week, almost $100 per month by making my own. Now pizza is fresh and ready on my time and it doesn't get steamed in a pizza box.

I know some people will disagree with my math. I welcome that. But I get just as excited about pizza night as I did before. Now I can make a pizza for a picnic or house party, and compared to other dishes it's less work, cheaper, and people get excited about it.

I was in the grocery store the other day looking for coconut milk. This can be quiet expensive if you don't look around. In the health food section they had some for $4. I went to the international foods section, there was a couple cans that were priced at $3 per can. I checked the baking aisle and low and behold they had some on sale for $0.99!

This happened to me with curry spices too! I looked in the regular spice section and a small bag of curry spice was $3. I searched in the Indian food section and a huge bag was $3. I got so much more for the same price!

Here are the habits I formed the last quarter of 2020 that I plan to utilize going forward. 

Coffee.
I bought reusable K-Cups. Purchased coffee separately. The savings is close to 80%. I will never buy K-Cups again for single-serve coffee.

*If you are purchasing coffee regularly from a chain location then that is a whole different situation. You might as well just burn your money in the fireplace.

Sodas
For health reasons and a personal test, I stopped drinking soda entirely. Those 12 and 24 packs add up. Between my wife and I we would go through 224 packs of diet mountain dew a week. On sale those would be $5.99 up to $8.99. plus a 10 cent deposit per can.

Instead I have been purchasing Crystal light, or drinking water and coffee only.

Toilet.
Just the wife and I. I have noticed a difference in our water bill by $30 by simply only flushing piss water once an evening.

I work night shift. wife goes to bed by 9:30 p.m. and I stay up until about 6:00 a.m.. If I am only peeing in the toilet I simply wait until I go to bed to flush once. Saves about a gallon and a half to two gallons per flush. Multiply that by 30 days and it saves significantly.

I'm no animal though, number two gets flushed immediately.

Aquarium.
I have a large aquarium that I adore. I utilize all the water for indoor plants as well as the garden in the summer. I've seen a better yield from crops used with fish poop water and I save significantly on city water.

Bottled water.
We have city water that tastes fine but mentally there are hurdles with drinking city water in our heads. bottled water is ridiculously overpriced and bad for the environment.

I have a 2002 accord v6, 158k mileage that was handed down from my family about 6 years ago. Since then it has been extremely reliable and I have never had a problem with it. I used it mainly for short commute to school, but there were a couple of long drives as well. I clocked less than 10k miles last year.

Oil change was always on time. There were some minor engine leak but it stopped once I used the high mileage oil instead of the full synthetic one. Breaks are good just recently changed. And since I live in a snow heavy region, I have winter tires that I go to a dealership to get them on and have alignment done for free as part of the tire deal. I know that these models tend to have transmission issue, but I might have been the lucky one no issue so far.

There are some rusting signs that I notice this winter season because of the road salts. And I think there’s a leak somewhere in the cooling because I constantly get frosting inside car windshield. Some minor cosmetic damages and the multi cd doesn’t work but I don’t care about that part. And this car is a gas guzzler I think I get 18 or less mpg due to short commute and cold weather.

Now the car is approaching its second timing belt change (first change was done by previous owner), I start asking the shops around me for a quote. The Honda dealership quoted 1,200$ for the timing belt/water pump. I’m waiting to hear from other shops but I doubt it will be less than 1000$. The car also needed all the fluids and coolant replaced as well as looking into all the coolant hoses for leak. And also rust since I’m not sure how much rust there is (don’t think there are a lot, but it was definitely showing). The car value is around 1500-2000$ according to kbb.

Would it be financially wise to go ahead and fix the car or for me to get another used car/new one with good rebates? I’m a medical student about to graduate in  a few months and going to residency position which pays about 60k per year, with significant debt in student loan. Part of me wants to stick to this car since it has been so reliable but the other part wants to get a newer car with better mileage and less maintenance cost. I was thinking of getting a new hybrid car - I was looking up the Prius Prime Plus and the dealership gave me a 21,000$ which was a 6k rebate from its price, and I can get 4500$ in federal tax rebate for the electric car. 

Edit: I ended up fixing the car which costed me around 1k for everything. Running fine for now hopefully it can last me another 3 years!",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,Fix an old car or buy a new one,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/akui0z/fix_an_old_car_or_buy_a_new_one/,all_ads,t3_akui0z,2,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1042642.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,,,1451460639.0,t2_tc2nh,0.0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,

I noticed just in the nick of time and was able to secure 10 cans of of my beloved for £1.50 on sale as presumably boots were trying to sell through stock of the old packaging to make way for the new more expensive ones.

Now Dove have introduced a shoddy basic line that are £2.50 a can and then the go fresh are considered their ‘premium’ £4.50 cans.

Now I’m at the stage where I’ve worked my way through my stock of deodorant and have to bite the bullet of paying the new price and tbh my heart breaks. I can’t pay £4.50 for deodorant but equally don’t think I could downgrade to another brand. 😭😭😭

I’m also a big believer in “buy it for life” if that’s a possibility.

That said, I want to know what little luxuries you have bought that are under say $50 and you really think they’ve improved your quality of life.

My two:
1. Bum gun - $35.  It’s just a cold sprayer but I live in the subtropics so it’s never all that cold. It’s not a full bidet. As someone with gastrointestinal issues (coeliac disease and lactose intolerance) it’s made a big difference to the general health of that area and much less irritation. I feel gross if I just have to use tp now!

2. Wi-fi switch - $15. I have attached this to my kettle - it is app controlled and set to go on at 6:15 every morning which is about 10 minutes before I get up.  I do have to remember to fill the kettle and put the switch on in the evening but it’s so good for me in the mornings, it just feels like a little treat to have my kettle already boiled and the temperature I like it in the morning.  I actually used birthday money to buy it, so I often think of the giver as well.

I'm kind of getting fed up with blankets and bedsheets taking ages to dry, so I just popped into my local laundrette to see how much it is to use their dryers. I thought it would be perhaps £1 or so.

I nearly fell over.

Depending on the size of the machine you use, you pay between £3.00 and £4.50 for one wash, and the dryer costs £1 per 15 minutes.

So, using the smallest washer + half an hour in the dryer = £5.00 ($8), using the largest washer + an hour in the dryer = £8.50 ($13.58).

And I don't even live in the most central part of London. I live in zone 3.

Imagine having a family and each wash load costing over $13? And the sad fact is that it's often people who are on the poverty line who don't have facilities in their own flats and have to use laundrettes. 

In comparison, you can buy a washing machine for £100 secondhand (or £400 new) and a typical machine wash will use around £0.50 in electricity (plus water costs).

It can be used as one sheet and you simply change the month, or make copies of the ""template"" sheet for each month. 

If you make copies of the template sheet it may say something about the name of formulas being the same, just click ""yes"" (or ""no"" and rename the formula to whatever)  I have no idea why it does that.

I've spent a lot of time researching what would be most effective for myself, and have determined that the must have ingredients for my pre-workout are beta-alanine, l-arginine, taurine and caffeine.  By buying the ingredients separately and in bulk, you can save a lot of money.  


**My blend contains:**


3.2g of beta-alanine, 4.6g of l-arginine, 3g of taurine, and 400mg of caffeine.  Flavoring is additional, I'll probably throw a crystal light packet in there.


**My reasoning:**


The non essential amino acid beta-alanine raises muscle carnosine levels, which allows you to perform at higher intensities by preventing  a buildup of H+ ions, which helps prevents lowering of pH in your muscles.  In addition, beta-alanine gives you that famous tingling feeling that gets you psyched to lift.
Beta-alanine and taurine compete for uptake, so in order to prevent long term health complications from a lack of taurine, I'm stacking it with the beta-alanine.  Aside from that, taurine itself has many benefits.
The semi-essential amino acid arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide, which causes vasodilation.  
Then of course, caffeine is essential for me to have energy to workout after a long day.

I'm a 20-year-old single mom to an 8 month old living with my mom and my two younger brothers. Money's really tight right now, and I've been thinking about ways to save. One idea that crossed my mind was switching to cloth diapers for my little one.

My mom is super against it though. She says that when you take in the cost of the diapers, detergent, extra water & electricity for washing them, plus time laundering and folding, it actually ends up being more expensive. She even did some math and calculated that with the extra utility costs and the initial investment in cloth diapers, it would take a long time to break even.

I'm not much of a math girl but I'm seriously strapped for cash. Does anyone have experience with this?

I do enjoy the fancy varieties but plain old coffee is all I really need to get me through the day. So I started making instant coffee in the mornings and it definitely hits the spot for me.

Even if it was the same or slightly more expensive, instant coffee doesn't require a coffee maker, filters, and there's pretty much no cleanup.

I also have a major problem with only eating what I'm in the exact mood for, ordering pizza/Chinese food when my fridge is full, and throwing things away because they went out of date. Infact, sometimes I'll have 5 shapes of pasta at home and then buy another one because I 'feel' like eating another shape. I buy 5 different types of flour and breadcrumbs and leave them for a year until they're out of date. I spend more than 100$/100euro per week on food, sometimes 150 - that's a lot for one person. Well, not anymore. I'm doing a pantry challenge - which means I plan on eating everything in my cupboard. It's not a sunk cost for me, since I'm alone I really shouldn't need to stockpile. Usually, I'd just have all of the below sitting at home and go and buy more but having written it all out.. wow ... I've got a LOT of food.

It is necessary to place a down payment, if so how much. How does the monthly payments work and I obviously do not have insurance does it cost me any to get a quote?

And if it helps I'm in the Odgen/Clear field, Utah area.

Because my work is tied to a university, I have a (forced) month off. My wife and I are buying a house, so I have been taking stock of our current practices and planning future frugal ideas.
Here are some of the tips and plans for saving money that I have gathered from this subreddit:

**–Cook good and healthy food for less:**
Fruggit has been wonderful in promoting this. Crock-pots/Slow-cookers are your friend. So are dried beans, good quality bulk rice, and many other frugal options. I've found http://budgetbytes.blogspot.ca/ to be very helpful. I've also found that one of the grocery store around me (in a much lower income area) stocks roughly the same items as the other stores, but never sells some of the nicer items. (organic items, good cheeses, etc) When they get close to the end of the shelf life, the store discounts then by 50% to get them off the shelves. Because of this I've adjusted my purchasing schedule to shop there 1-2 times a week, buying fresh fruits/veggies/etc and whatever is dramatically discounted, and then plan meals around this.

**–Get a chest freezer:** 
Gives you the space to take advantage of really cheap food deals, as well as allows you to buy more things in bulk. We will be buying one as soon as we move into our house. (BTW: Lowes always has 10% off coupons in the post office's new address forms. This turns a $200 7 cu. ft. freezer into a $180 one)

**–Get a cheaper cell phone plan:** 
This is a hard one for me. My wife has 22% off at Verizon, and I use my smart phone more often then I use a computer. (which I use ALL the time) With factoring in what the cost of a new high end smartphone would cost, it's still cheaper to get off the Verizon plan, so we likely will switch when our contract is us in 6 months, but it's only a savings of $7-$10 a month. I need to make sure that the coverage and extra features of a pre-paid phone plan are worth it.
However, as a rule pre-paid plans have always been cheaper. I had one for 2 years before I got a contract phone. (needed reception at school, Verizon has the only tower)

**–Make your own laundry detergent:** 
It only took me about an hour to make a powdered detergent from Borax, Washing Soda, and Bar Soap. (1 cup, 1 cup and ½ bar respectively) 
There are tons of recopies. [This is the one I used](http://www.diynatural.com/homemade-laundry-detergent-soap/) Rough cost estimates for me were 900 loads for ~$20. Cheapest equivalent was Aldi's detergent at 360 loads for $25.

**– Look for cheaper means of transportation:**
With each of us having jobs, as well as things like grad school, non profit board meetings, and after school tutoring programs it's not yet been practical for us to move down from two vehicles. I have long fantasized about owning a moped/scooter that's under 50cc  so I could get rid of my terrible car (which with some DIY mechanical work I have somehow kept running) and have an insurance/title free vehicle along with a main car. This may never happen, but would provide a significant amount of savings. We also don't have a good means of public transit.

**–Brew your own alcohol: (Well... at least beer and wine...)**
[r/Homebrewing](http://reddit.com/r/homebrewing) is awesome. I've just started testing the waters of brewing with some 1 gallon test batches of apfelwein. (apple wine) Ciders and meads don't usually require boiling, so there is less initial equipment to purchase, but even for making beer, after the ~$150 initial purchase, your batches will run between $20-$40 for 50-60 bottles of beer that's better than from the store. It's not for everyone, but it's a hobby I'm interested in, and will save money in the long run.

**–Start putting into place energy efficient items in your house:**
I've read countless good ideas for this. Here are a few: 
Smart power strip for TV set ups(Saves about $12/yr) 
 CFL bulbs, 
Water saving shower heads (already using so it won't be an adjustment)
Water Saving Toilet systems: Dual Flush Kit (Or even putting a 2-liter filled with water into your tank to reduce water usage. I like having the full/half flush option)


**–Don't pay for cable, and buy a modem instead of renting one:**
I will have to use Comcrap cable services for internet because they are the only thing in the area. I will definitely buy a modem (it will cost about $40) instead of renting one for $5 a month.
Instead of a cable package get a Roku player (~$50-$60 if you look for a cheap model refurbished or on sale, there are plenty of similar items you could get instead) with your choice of Hulu Plus/Netflix/Amazon prime video. 
Assuming Comcast doesn't play the “force you to bundle with a 'basic cable' package of over-the-air channels for a dollar or two more than just internet which you're not allow to buy ala carte” game, I will also buy a HDTV antenna. [r/cordcutters](http://reddit.com/r/cordcutters) is a great place for information. 

**–Restore or build your own furniture:**
I've recently started getting my feet wet in some DIY projects. ([r/DIY](http://reddit.com/r/DIY) is a great as well) I build a headboard for our bed for under $50. A friend gave us a large wooden spool that my wife and I are going to convert into a table/bookshelf combo. With a few tools, and some time you can save hundreds of dollars and have the satisfaction of building things yourself.

**– Exercise outside of a gym:**
Paying for a gym membership in my opinion can be a frugal option if it makes you exercise, (so many benefits from exercising... I need to do it more) but it's very easy and totally free to go for a walk/job/run outside, and from just a monetary perspective it will save you tons of health care money down the road.

–(For those who have a good handle on their spending) **Use a rewards credit card instead of a debit card:**
I fully understand this is not a good idea for some people. I could tell you several of my friends who I would specifically recommend to not use a credit card. However, in my situation, where I have great mutual accountability between me and my wife, the $300 sign-up bonus and the 1-5% cash back on purchases has been a nice source of extra money, and hasn't increased our spending at all.

**– Use Open-office and Google Docs instead of Microsoft Office:**
While some people need the extra features that Microsoft Office provides (Such as Excel... can't really get a comparable substitute), it amazes me that many people I know do not take advantage of these free and powerful alternatives to a $100 software package.

**– Get your personal finances in order:**
To echo what seems to be the mantra of [r/personalfinance](http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance): Get out of debt, Save up a 6 month emergency fund, max out an employer matched 401K plan, then start investing in indexed mutual funds. Make the money you've saved work for you.

I totally didn't think about that...",,False,,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,,,self,,,A list of things I have learned from R/Frugal,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/tob1g/a_list_of_things_i_have_learned_from_rfrugal/,,t3_tob1g,992,1.0,,,,,,,0.0,1337099069.0,329.0,,,0.0,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First time posting here, although I&#39;ve been reading this subreddit for some time now. Because my work is tied to a university, I have a (forced) month off. My wife and I are buying a house, so I have been taking stock of our current practices and planning future frugal ideas.
Here are some of the tips and plans for saving money that I have gathered from this subreddit:</p>

<p><strong>–Cook good and healthy food for less:</strong>
Fruggit has been wonderful in promoting this. Crock-pots/Slow-cookers are your friend. So are dried beans, good quality bulk rice, and many other frugal options. I&#39;ve found <a href=""http://budgetbytes.blogspot.ca/"">http://budgetbytes.blogspot.ca/</a> to be very helpful. I&#39;ve also found that one of the grocery store around me (in a much lower income area) stocks roughly the same items as the other stores, but never sells some of the nicer items. (organic items, good cheeses, etc) When they get close to the end of the shelf life, the store discounts then by 50% to get them off the shelves. Because of this I&#39;ve adjusted my purchasing schedule to shop there 1-2 times a week, buying fresh fruits/veggies/etc and whatever is dramatically discounted, and then plan meals around this.</p>

<p><strong>–Get a chest freezer:</strong> 
Gives you the space to take advantage of really cheap food deals, as well as allows you to buy more things in bulk. We will be buying one as soon as we move into our house. (BTW: Lowes always has 10% off coupons in the post office&#39;s new address forms. This turns a $200 7 cu. ft. freezer into a $180 one)</p>

<p><strong>–Get a cheaper cell phone plan:</strong> 
This is a hard one for me. My wife has 22% off at Verizon, and I use my smart phone more often then I use a computer. (which I use ALL the time) With factoring in what the cost of a new high end smartphone would cost, it&#39;s still cheaper to get off the Verizon plan, so we likely will switch when our contract is us in 6 months, but it&#39;s only a savings of $7-$10 a month. I need to make sure that the coverage and extra features of a pre-paid phone plan are worth it.
However, as a rule pre-paid plans have always been cheaper. I had one for 2 years before I got a contract phone. (needed reception at school, Verizon has the only tower)</p>

<p><strong>–Make your own laundry detergent:</strong> 
It only took me about an hour to make a powdered detergent from Borax, Washing Soda, and Bar Soap. (1 cup, 1 cup and ½ bar respectively) 
There are tons of recopies. <a href=""http://www.diynatural.com/homemade-laundry-detergent-soap/"">This is the one I used</a> Rough cost estimates for me were 900 loads for ~$20. Cheapest equivalent was Aldi&#39;s detergent at 360 loads for $25.</p>

<p><strong>– Look for cheaper means of transportation:</strong>
With each of us having jobs, as well as things like grad school, non profit board meetings, and after school tutoring programs it&#39;s not yet been practical for us to move down from two vehicles. I have long fantasized about owning a moped/scooter that&#39;s under 50cc  so I could get rid of my terrible car (which with some DIY mechanical work I have somehow kept running) and have an insurance/title free vehicle along with a main car. This may never happen, but would provide a significant amount of savings. We also don&#39;t have a good means of public transit.</p>

<p><strong>–Brew your own alcohol: (Well... at least beer and wine...)</strong>
<a href=""http://reddit.com/r/homebrewing"">r/Homebrewing</a> is awesome. I&#39;ve just started testing the waters of brewing with some 1 gallon test batches of apfelwein. (apple wine) Ciders and meads don&#39;t usually require boiling, so there is less initial equipment to purchase, but even for making beer, after the ~$150 initial purchase, your batches will run between $20-$40 for 50-60 bottles of beer that&#39;s better than from the store. It&#39;s not for everyone, but it&#39;s a hobby I&#39;m interested in, and will save money in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>–Start putting into place energy efficient items in your house:</strong>
I&#39;ve read countless good ideas for this. Here are a few: 
Smart power strip for TV set ups(Saves about $12/yr) 
 CFL bulbs, 
Water saving shower heads (already using so it won&#39;t be an adjustment)
Water Saving Toilet systems: Dual Flush Kit (Or even putting a 2-liter filled with water into your tank to reduce water usage. I like having the full/half flush option)</p>

<p><strong>–Don&#39;t pay for cable, and buy a modem instead of renting one:</strong>
I will have to use Comcrap cable services for internet because they are the only thing in the area. I will definitely buy a modem (it will cost about $40) instead of renting one for $5 a month.
Instead of a cable package get a Roku player (~$50-$60 if you look for a cheap model refurbished or on sale, there are plenty of similar items you could get instead) with your choice of Hulu Plus/Netflix/Amazon prime video. 
Assuming Comcast doesn&#39;t play the “force you to bundle with a &#39;basic cable&#39; package of over-the-air channels for a dollar or two more than just internet which you&#39;re not allow to buy ala carte” game, I will also buy a HDTV antenna. <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/cordcutters"">r/cordcutters</a> is a great place for information. </p>

<p><strong>–Restore or build your own furniture:</strong>
I&#39;ve recently started getting my feet wet in some DIY projects. (<a href=""http://reddit.com/r/DIY"">r/DIY</a> is a great as well) I build a headboard for our bed for under $50. A friend gave us a large wooden spool that my wife and I are going to convert into a table/bookshelf combo. With a few tools, and some time you can save hundreds of dollars and have the satisfaction of building things yourself.</p>

<p><strong>– Exercise outside of a gym:</strong>
Paying for a gym membership in my opinion can be a frugal option if it makes you exercise, (so many benefits from exercising... I need to do it more) but it&#39;s very easy and totally free to go for a walk/job/run outside, and from just a monetary perspective it will save you tons of health care money down the road.</p>

<p>–(For those who have a good handle on their spending) <strong>Use a rewards credit card instead of a debit card:</strong>
I fully understand this is not a good idea for some people. I could tell you several of my friends who I would specifically recommend to not use a credit card. However, in my situation, where I have great mutual accountability between me and my wife, the $300 sign-up bonus and the 1-5% cash back on purchases has been a nice source of extra money, and hasn&#39;t increased our spending at all.</p>

<p><strong>– Use Open-office and Google Docs instead of Microsoft Office:</strong>
While some people need the extra features that Microsoft Office provides (Such as Excel... can&#39;t really get a comparable substitute), it amazes me that many people I know do not take advantage of these free and powerful alternatives to a $100 software package.</p>

DO NOT PUT YOUR ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH ON OR IN THE CHARGER STATION AFTER USE. Only charge the battery once it is empty. As in really drained. I have extended the lifespan of my (rechargeable) battery powered thingies considerably, and so can you!

The problem being it was so sudden- unexpected. I'm 25 years old, have decent credit, and could afford all credit card bills+car payment+kiddos school stuff+groceries. 

I need to make extreme changes in a very short time. 

I've switched to a different phone plan (lowering bill from $200 to $50) 

I've been going to our local food pantry as necessary, but grocery bill isn't substantially lower since my daughter has severe allergies (can't get specialized products otherwise)

I have 1 dog, 2 cats. I changed my kitties food from wet to dry, saving a bit of money. 

Canceled all monthly subscriptions. 

Started going to TJ Maxx and other discount stores for dog treats/bones. 

Began turning off all lights unless absolutely necessary. Maybe cutting energy bill in half. Wearing clothes multiple times in a row rather than once. Quicker showers. No unnecessary drives/fast food/etc. 

Are there other things I can do to lower costs? What food stores are cheapest, or cheapest for kids essentials? Which no name brands for laundry detergent is best?

I currently own a 2001 Mercedes E320 with 185k miles on it and overall it runs pretty well. However, I took it in to the shop for an oil change and a diagnostic for a check engine light and apparently both my catalytic converters need to be replaced and the estimate was just under $2000. This is on top of about $85/mo for insurance and about $75/mo for gas if I keep driving to a minimum.

Hypothetically, I could pay for this, but I'm only saving between $100 and $250 a month. 2 grand is not something I want to just blow on a repair like that. The car runs well in spite of this issue and I've decided to sell it. However, I would still like to have the flexibility of my own personal vehicle so I can visit my parents at times (an hour away). I'm considering purchasing a used motorcycle after taking the riding class. I would probably use it as a commuter bike as driving is significantly easier than riding metro to work.

Has anyone done something similar?

Just wanted to say we got two bills total: one for hospital services that was around $1,100 and one for doctor/nurse services for $845.

This was one hell of a shock, but my SO took it upon himself to use advice in the thread to whittle down the costs. The hospital absolutely refused to budge on their bill save for a 40% savings from paying the bill within 10 days or fill out a charity application which would take weeks to months and would have to be voted on by a board of directors there before the process even got started. There was no guarantee of it going through at all. It required all sorts of information (2 months of bank statements, 2 months pay stubs, and even last year's tax return) to determine eligibility. 

He simply did not time or energy to devote to a 'maybe' with his second year of college less than a week away. (Some people will call us suckers here, but he was worrying himself to death about it. It was not worth his mental health to wait.) We decided to just suck it up, pony up the money out of savings and get the 40% discount, which ended up with around $750 out of pocket.

The doctor bill came later that week, so he immediately phoned the billing center out of another state. He felt much more comfortable going into a payment plan now that effectively half the bill was taken care of, but he told the billing center rep his story, who said she'd speak with the doctor about a discount. Just yesterday, we were informed the bill was reduced to $420! He was pretty happy about it. He'll start on a payment plan of about $50 a month to get it knocked out in less than a year.

Thank you all for your help. We were a total nervous wrecks at the time of posting, so it really helped to have sympathetic ears and sound advice.

.  
I am an avid reader here, but to protect my privacy I have created this throwaway.  

.  
So here's the gist of things: I am a 20 year old, male, college junior planning on attending medical school (in Illinois) after graduation. This means I will be graduating with approximately ~$25k in undergraduate debt (federal subsidized / unsubsidized). As you might expect, I will also not have funds to pay for the cost of medical school out of pocket (which has a tuition of around $50k a year). Nor will I have funds for the daily cost of living.  

.  
I have come to understand that it is typical, if not expected that medical school students loan these large sums of money in order to pay for their schooling, rent, daily living expenses, etc.

.  
Luckily I will be living with a roommate whom will be able to split the costs of food, rent, utilities, etc. Even so, the concept of going so deeply into debt frankly terrifies me. The problem is, when it comes to medical school, debt becomes a necessary evil as focusing on saving money (as I typically would like to) becomes a luxury I will no longer be allowed.  
.  
This is where you come in. Even though I know that I will *need* to incur a large sum of debt in a relativity short time frame, I want to be as informed about it as possible. What are some things that I should be considering at this time? Do you have any recommendations about spending, budgeting, etc that you feel might apply to my situation? Do you have any suggestions as to how I should go about loaning such large quantities of money?

.  
Thank you all in advanced!!

Any Christmas/holiday cards you get, keep. Instead of throwing them out when the festive season is over, use the lovely pictures and patterns to your advantage and make them into gift tags. You can use normal scissors or the patterned ones to make them more decorative as you cut them out. 

Then you can then either hole punch the corner and attach to gifts with string or just tape them straight onto the package on one side so it can flip open.

Fayetteville, AR

Quakers have historically valued traveling because they believe it helps us [value what is shared among all of us as humans.](https://www.friendsjournal.org/traveling-ministry/) To promote the sharing that comes through travel,  many Quaker meetinghouses maintain very modest traveler's rooms for 1-2 people. They are a modest price particularly for the urban centers where Quaker meetinghouses are mostly located.  Small families can book two rooms. 

[Here's an example in Seattle](https://www.ufmseattle.org/lodging). One person is 50/night, two people are 60/night.

You do not need to a Quaker to stay at a meetinghouse. You should be prepared to not be an asshole: most of the rooms will in homes shared by the meetinghouse caretaker or a fellowship group. If you're looking for a luxe, you're not going to find it. But most Quaker traveler's rooms will have access to a kitchenette, showers and bathrooms.

Here is a breakdown of why: 

Texture: Lint is broken down fibers and has zero structure of its own. This leaves the risk of the nest creating holes over time as it gets wet or disturbed by winds. 

Chemicals: Detergents, fabric softeners and dryer sheets contain perfumes, soap residue and artificial dyes that end up in dryer lint. Large concentrations of these chemicals in lint can make it particularly toxic to the tiny animals. The micro plastics shed by clothing are also, obviously, bad for birds. 

Smell: Most birds do not have a significant sense of smell, but those same scents may attract predators to an exposed nest.

Residue: Small particles of dry, loose lint are easy to disturb can be airborne in the nest and can be inhaled by birds. This dust can cause respiratory distress and even choking or suffocation in severe cases.

Mildew: When dryer lint gets wet it takes longer for the moisture to dry than more natural materials. A damp and moist nest may chill the baby birds, but the damp lint can develop toxic mold or mildew.

Tackiness: Wet dryer lint pulls apart easily but can stick to the nest surfaces and can become caked on birds' legs, feet and feathers.

It was just a norm.

Then I woke up and instead of $15-20 chipotle for lunch, I opted for $5-6 premade sandwiches at supermarkets. They honestly are kind of gross and feel unhealthy. But I already cut my daily spending in half. I’ve done this for about a week or two.

Then yesterday I made the biggest change. I bought a rotisserie chicken on sell for $5, had some pita bread laying around, and bought some microwave veggies for less than $2.

I ate some of the chicken for dinner, and this morning packed some more with a pita bread for lunch. Now my lunch is like $2-3. Compared to $15-20.

I’m easily going to save a lot more money now and might even get deeper into stuff like buying raw chicken breast instead and cooking it myself. But buying a $5-7 rotisserie chicken seems to make the most sense because it’s so easy and tasty (is there a con?)

I think I can survive on two meals a day. I usually don’t eat anything until 12 pm anyway. Then there’s snacks, that’s my weakness. Should I be relaxed when it comes to paying for snacks? Like I prefer a $4-5 can of whipped cream and a $4 box of Oreos and eat at least one row of ores with the can of whipped cream to be happy.

Or if I have a Cadbury chocolate bar that’s still like $3-4.

I'm trying to create a list to share with my younger cousin. I want to make him aware of things that can end up costing him a lot of money in the long run.

One that I've noticed is coffee. Some people always buy their coffee from coffee shops like Caribou or Starbucks, costing about $2.50.
Then there is the option to get a bag of higher end coffee beans from Caribou or Starbucks which cost about $0.36 per cup or cheaper/generic brand of beans that cost about $0.22 per cup. 

Assuming you drink a cup a day, everyday, for a full year, that would be:
$912.5 for coffee from a coffee shop
$131.4 for high end coffee beans
$80.3 for cheaper coffee beans

That's a significant savings just to brew coffee at home, even if its a higher end brand of coffee beans. Even if you think the coffee and atmosphere is better at a coffee store, you should ask yourself if it's worth an extra +$700 a year.

I'm 20. She is is 40. 
Background: mother drove my father into debt & bankruptcy a few years back. She is $20K in debt.

I let my mother be an authorized user (not cosigner) with one of my credit cards. $500 is the credit limit. However, she always maxes it out every month. She pays part of it, yes. My whole credit allowance is $10K, so $500 is small percentage.

I told her a few rules: Advise me beforehand of a big purchase. Pay a big portion off. Basic courtesy, pretty much. She hasn't done any of them. She makes partial payments, yes.

I've become a bit...uncomfortable, as you can imagine.

Am I an idiot? I'm feeling like one. How should I handle this? I really don't want to be an asshole to my mother. Please advise.


**1rd Update:** Thank you everyone for your input. Some of you got really fired up, which was amusing but indicative. I'll have a talk with my beloved mother. It's not easy, but it's for her & my good. The money order thing is a good idea. I hate to be like this, but I have to pull the plug eventually. Thank you r/frugal =)

**2st Update:** If any you are  mothers, please don't be like my mom. It hurts and puts us sons/daughters in awkward situations. It's hard to say no to the woman who birthed us. It really is.

**3th Update:** You guys are really fired up over this. My post is number 1rd on r/frugal 0.o Guys, my story isn't that special, really. I asked for advice and I def got it lol. I don't see my mommy often, but I'll talk to her next week. I sent her a few texts demanding a payment *like a boss*, & she said she'll pay. Regardless, Imma need to talk to her in person. I think I'll freeze this credit card after she makes payments and take her off next month. I feel like chit about my mom :( So, if any moms want to apply to be my mom, feel free. Im a good son and I always send mothers day gift & hug :)

You guys are so fired up, I still can't get over that. I guess American do hate injustice. If only we could put that energy into our politicians....

With birthday comes gift, though — and I don’t live close, so I’m already spending on the gas to get there. In addition, I imagine the kid is swamped with toys. So I’d like to find something else — preferably something useful — to give that also won’t cost a lot of money. 

I’m also at the disadvantage of not knowing much about babies. He is developmentally delayed; according to a family member who knows more about kids, he’s a few months behind on “milestones.”

I would also like to start cooking food in batches and freezing it, but there's just no room in my freezer at the moment. I'm even not saving food scraps (vegetable peels, etc) anymore because they don't fit in the freezer. 

Problem is, I have a tiny tiny kitchen and I only have space for a small upright freezer (I don't have a mudroom, an attic, a dining room, or a garage). I spent days measuring my kitchen and the only way I could have a proper upright freezer would be if I stack it on top the washing machine. Even the corridor leading to the kitchen isn't wide enough for a freezer. And I don't want to have the freezer on the living room or the office. 

My issue is, small freezers don't seem very energy efficient: I've been comparing equipments and a 32l freezer can take as much energy to run as a 70l one. On one hand, the extra freezer space would be useful. On the other hand, why am I paying for a small freezer that costs as much to run as a large one??

There is always a few things that just don't even click in our brains as something to make from scratch, right?  True for me anyway.  One of those things was alfredo sauce.  I just always bought the jarred stuff.  

It wasn't until I saw a tiktok video about how in Italy, the real authentic stuff is quite literally parmesean, butter & pasta water.  The idea that they didn't even traditionally use milk just blew my mind.  I went down this rabbit hole of alfredo sauce recipes.  

Something I determined, seems to be true no matter the recipe...homemade alfredo sauce ingredients may initially cost more than buying a couple jars as needed.  But those recipes make a ton of sauce!  Its a big frugal win for my family!

At my grocery store depending on brand, (1) 14-16 oz. jar of alfredo sauce costs somewhere between $3 & $5 bucks.

The ingredients for this bomb alfredo sauce I just made was 

(1)quart of half & half

(1 1/2) cups grated parmesean

(2)sticks of butter 

(1) tsp garlic powder

S&P to taste
  
Melt butter in pot, pour the half & half in, stir constantly till hot (not boiling), dump in the cheese & whisk vigorously, toss in the seasoning & voila.  It was a little thin at first because I used half & half instead of heavy cream.  But if you cook the noods al dente & let them finish in the sauce, the starch from the noodles thicken the sauce to perfection!

Literally made half a stock pot, had to be atleast 6 jars worth of the store bought stuff.  Cost of those ingredients approx $11 dollars.  Could have easily been less.  

Used half the sauce I made with a pound of sgetti & froze the rest.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, so here is how I went on reducing my utilities by almost 80% and this is with starting from a lower base already vs average american house.

&#x200B;

We live in about 2200 sq ft of house, ranch style. Built in 1958, so lots of leaky. When I first moved in with my now wife, the average usage of utilities was the following:

\- Electricity 760 kWh/month

\- Gas (water and heat) - 820 therms annually

&#x200B;

I think it's best to keep numbers in consumption than actuall dollars (although I provide those as well), since prices differ around the country and also with time. The average price in my area is about 12 cents per kWh in electricity and 1 dollar give or take per therm of NG.

&#x200B;

We live in the Northeast and Winters are cold - according to the average our winters are about 6100 Heating Degree Days and it gets hot and humid in summer.

&#x200B;

Here's what I did chronologically:

&#x200B;

\#1 - First move was to change all light bulbs to CFLs. This was in 2013 so LEDs were still very expensive at around 9-10$ per bulb. Since CFLs don't differ that much from power output from LEDs (maybe like 20%) it never made sense $$ wise to go for LEDs when CFLs were available at 1-2 dollars a pop. Before, the whole power output of light bulbs in the house was around 2000-3000 W... when all bulbs were changed the whole power output in the house sits around at 250-300W ... As an example, TODAY if we have the whole house with the lights on, it would use less energy than before when we had 3-5 lights on in the living room 6 hours a day or so. Cost on new lights = $70

&#x200B;

\#2 - I am frugal (hence being here...or at least as my mother tells me I am Spartan. I don't mind paying for things of good quality), therefore the dumb thermostats never echoed with me. In 2013 I bought a NEST. At the time I believe NEST was the only wifi t-stat and while I know I could probably get by with a programmable thermostat, the designs were not that appealing and I liked having the wifi access anyhow. Of course I didn't buy it new. Bought it off of ebay in 2013 for about $95. It's been now almost 6 years, and never had an issue with it. It paid itself in no time. With the Nest I started putting the heat off whenever out of the house or at night (with setbacks in the mid 50s). This itself brought big savings in orders of 30-40% in heat. Cost = $95

&#x200B;

\#3 Changing electrical suppliers - PA has a liberal market in the energy market, meaning you can choose who your supplier is from hundredds of suppliers. They website is pretty easy to navigate as well. Just input your zipcode and a lot of offers from different companies pop up. Just organize the list by Lowest Price to Highest and you're golden. You can usually get 20-35% lower prices than what the distribution company provides. These are all usually introductory offers for a limited amount of time (like 3, 6 or 12 months for example) so once that time expires just pop onto the website and go for the lowest offer again and jump to a different company. Been doing this for 4-5 years now and it takes maybe 10 minutes every 6 months. For those of you that use 1,000 or more kWh/month it's definitely worth it.

&#x200B;

\#4 While renovating and redesigning our living room to open space, we had to put a beam and with this access to attic. While up there and since we had the whole thing torn apart we decided to add insulation. Being the perfectionist that I am, I didn't want to just spray insulation on top of what we had there (4-5 inches of loose fiberglass and some spaces even lacking). Air leaks and cracks, even when insulated on top, leak a lot of air, so I wanted to seal off everything. So, we removed all Fiberglass in trash bags by using a leaf blower in reverse and using flexible air ducts to bring all loose fiberglass downstairs to a big mesh bag. This enabled me to air seal all cracks, top plates and fan cans and light boxes from the attic. We decided to put about 18"" of cellulose on our attic for a total of about R65-R70.

Our local Lowe's sold each bag at 12.95 dollars which is expensive IMO - we needed about 120 bags. A local store also had bags at about 8 dollars per bag if buying 100 of them, but Lowes had the FREE machine to spray the insulation which we needed. So I played the price match game with Lowes, where they priced matched it to 7,20 per bag and I also used they 50 off of 250 coupons in order to bring the price lower. Not only that, buying Lowes gift cards at 10-15% discount from 3rd party gift card markets brought it even lower, along with cashback portals. In the end we paid for each bag about $4,90/bag !! Also, our electrical supplier had and still has lots of rebates going for insulation improvements (it's always worth checking it out. I received an extra $130 from the electrical provider, but if my heat were to be electric as well, they would cover 80% of the cost up to 450 dollars, while in my case it was only 25% of the cost up to $130.

Total cost = $400

&#x200B;

\#5 Fridge - we had an old fridge that came with the house when we bought it. I knew it was old from the start but not as old as I ended up finding. Great machine! Cooled things like no other fridge did and probably will outlast any of the new ones, but I digress. The fridge was built in either 1983 or 1992 judging from the serial number and a little bit of Google. I would honestly say it is a 1983. However that thing used about 3 kWh/day. It never made much sense to just buy a new one just for the sake of it, but we had it in the plans to buy one that would go with our renovation. And we did exactly that recently. We bought a nice European fridge from a warehouse at a steep discount and sold the other one on Craigslist for $230 dollars. In the end, the NET cost of the new fridge was $450. Best thing though, the new fridge only uses about 0.2-0.4 kWh per day !!

&#x200B;

So here's how much we used to spend on utilities before all this:

\- Old spending $2200/year give or take

&#x200B;

With all the improvements we are now using only 190-200 kWh/month and this includes using dryer, landscape lights (LED of course) and cooking (we cook everyday) and having computer 24/7. Heat wise, this year we have only spent 200 therms of gas during an average winter of 6000 HDDs. Better yet, we don't have aggressive setbacks anymore. We keep the house always at 60F when sleeping or away, and around 68F when at home, so in essence we even increase indoor temps and the savings were that big!

Also, during the summer, while before the house used to get hot pretty quick, we can usually get by a full day without AC unless it's a heat wave of several days or the temps at night don't drop enough where opening windows and using fan would bring the temperatures lower.

&#x200B;

The new spending is therefore $750/year (already confirmed throguh the last 12 months). Consumption decrease almost 80% and spending almost 70%. There isn't much more we can save now. The only way, would be instead of having gas heat, change it to electricity through European multi-splits system, where we wouldn't need ducts and by being electricity we could drop the gas contract (which the customer charge is $17/month). The mini-split system would give both AC and Heat and since most of them have COP of 4 or higher it would end up being cheaper to use than NG (not by much though). But both our furnace and AC are pretty new - put in by prevous owner - installed around 2010 or so according to manufacture date of systems on their labels. Another way to save would be having a on-demand water heat but since ours is still pretty new it doesn't make sense to change as of now just to save some pennies. The same goes for windows (our windows while they are double pane they are crap) which would cost a lot just to save a couple dollars. Same for wall insulation - I'd love to insulate my walls - but when running the numbers and hassle of insulating the walls (which our house is lacking I am sure) it doesn't make sense. Our highest electric bill is about 40ish dollars in the summer and highest gas bill was 50 dollars back in Jan/February (coldest months)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k3nw8u85bd131.png

&#x200B;

And by these improvements instead of 3 tons of AC size, next time we need a new AC system, we can go by with only 1ton or 1.5 tons max which is crazy. And for all environmentalists out there, we are saving the planet 10 Metric tons (22,000 lbs) of CO2 emissions on a yearly basis.

&#x200B;

So all this to say, that you dont need a lot of money to get big returns! For about $1000 (and this includes a new fridge) and a lot of DIY work and being smart on how you buy your materials, you can save a lot and increase the comfort of your home. It pays to check for rebates as well! And you don't need to have good wall insulation for the most part, most of the returns come from insulating the heck out of your attic! And you can totally use HDDs and current usage and estimate the savings before hand to see if it's worth it. I did mine and my estimates weren't that far off from what ended up being in reality.

&#x200B;

Hopefully this post will be of help to someone.

The more info you share the better. If you do want to share some info, but much less then my below questions, that is fine with me as well, since that is useful data too. And if more people are willing to share only a little, we still have more data to look at in the end.

Also, if you don't have an exact figure for any of the questions, a ballpark can still be helpful: e.g. ""US$ 100-200"".

Oh, and if you didn't calculate this yourself, but know of some resource online, I'm all ears all the same.

I'm hoping to gain the following insights by gathering this data:

1. Find out which bike has the least amount of TCO (total cost of ownership). `(purchacePrice+totalMaintenence)/yearsOperational`, or instead of `yearsOperational`, could be `kilometersRode`.
1. Find out which bike on the market requires the least amount of maintenance. Both in terms of money and time spent.
1. Find out if it's true that with low purchase price come high maintenance costs later on.
1. Find out if there is a sweet spot where both the purchase price and the maintenance costs are at their lowest. And if so, find out where it is.

So, without further ado, here are my questions:

1. What's the make and model of the bike?
1. When did you buy it?
1. How much did you spend on the purchase?
1. Are you still using this bike? If no, what happened to it? Is it defunkt/sold/stolen/other?
1. If you are no longer using it, how long did you use it? (specified in years, perhaps)
1. How much did you spend on maintenance and upkeep since the purchase?
	
	Like I said, if you don't have an exact figure, a ballpark can still be helpful: e.g. ""US$ 100-200"".
	Feel free to go as rough or as detailed on this question as you like. If you have and are willing to share a spreadsheet table of maintenance costs and parts you had to purchase with a timestamp each, that's all the better.

1. How many kilometers/miles did you ride total?
1. How much/often/frequently did you use it? (I am not sure how relevant this question is. Maybe in absence of data for the above question it still can be useful)

1. Did you buy new or used?
1. Where did you buy it? I.e. which country?
1. What type of road did you use it on? E.g. Only good quality asphalt/cobblestone/dirt/other?
1. What kind of bike is it? roadbike/mountainbike/commuter/trekking/other? (feel free to specify more than one if applicable)
1. What did/do you use it for? road trips/commuting/off road/other? (feel free to specify more than one if applicable)
1. Would you like to share a picture of the bike?
1. Anything else you'd like to add that may be relevant? Or irrelevant?

My room:

I wanted some decorative shelving for my room. I made a bookcase out of an old ladder that was in my parent's garage and some scrap wood. It's more decorative than functional, but I like it a lot. 

Bonus: The apartment has really high ceilings, so when a light bulb needs to be changed I can take the shelves off and use the ladder as it was meant to be used.

To people who have been on cruises, was it worth it?

How do people shop for one, usually bulk buys work out cheaper but you end up with too much?  I usually only stuff I can freeze. Shopping is designed for families, buying for one such as a cake is crazy with the costs. 
I usually end up making one and freezing it.  

Sometimes it just nice to eat out. 

Cooking at home is great but then the multiple ingredients for one get expensive and on the other end ready made food tastes rubbish completed to home made.

I’ve been juggling credit card debt from one card to another for months before finally paying them both off today. I decided to stop using the credit card unless for emergency because I always over spend and end up carrying some of the balance over.

My monthly income varies because I’m in sales and work a part time job as well which I may be forced to leave soon. Most months though I should be pulling in at least $2200 take home. Most months closer to 4000 but I’m keeping it low so I can put the extra into paying off debt when I can. 

My essential bills come up to about 1250. Which is about half of what my budget is.
Insurance - 350.00 
Internet - 113.00 
Phone - 97.00 
Car payment - 152.00 
Spotify - 10.00  
Gas - 400 

My only plan now is calculating my budgets for the remaining amount of month. This month I’ve managed to spend the following. 
450 on restaurants and eating out, 250 on weed, 300 going out with friends and 40 on random hygiene stuff. The rest of my money went towards frivolous purchases that I don’t need and paying off some of my debt which is about 11 grand that I hope to payoff this year.

How can I plan out a more reasonable budget because I didn’t realize until I went over the credit card summary’s how much I was spending a month on useless stuff.

Groceries are between 50-60 a week for me and it’s so hard to make it work. I only had $30 last week and I didn’t know what to get because food is so expensive. But, I found out Taco Bell has an online exclusive combo that includes three food items, chips, and a soda all for $5. It’s a lot of food for me so I can stretch it throughout the day.

But man, i’m hungry and grumpy and would kill to eat some veggies bc ordering fast food every single day makes my body feel like garbage.

My macbook pro from 2010 is also hitting the end of it's life according to the battery, though I plan to keep it until it truly can't keep up.

Right now I'm on my parents' family plan with Verizon and they don't ask me to pay anything. I want to, but the budget is tight and so I don't.

If I were to get a cheap android phone or something and go with a MVNO carrier like Republic Wireless or Red Pocket Mobile or something, became more disciplined with data usage, and then just picked up an iPad for around the home or on the go browsing via wifi, do you think I could come out ahead (edit:) and would it benefit my parents?

I realize that's a bit of an upfront investment, and I would be budgeting for it (instead of the new computer). But are the savings there if I bought a refurbished, current gen iPad (whenever I buy it) to use as my netflix/browsing/social media/notes and lists machine and used the phone just for phone stuff?

Washers and dryers in the basement for $2 each. Not too bad. Machines are larger than average and work pretty well. I'm not working as much right now so I can do laundry once every 10 to 25 days. When I'm working more it's closer to once a week. These are my top 10 ways I keep my laundry budget tight!


1. Only buy laundry detergent on sale. This way seem obvious.. but really, at least once a week either Wal Mart or Superstore has a really good price on one or two of the better detergents. (I don't believe in cheating out and getting the lowest no name price items for laundry. Having clean, fresh, stain free, good smelling clothes is important to me. Best 3 in my opinion are Tide, Gain, Sunlight.)

2. Buy a detergent that is suitable for cold water - still only buying this on sale but I do feel like it makes a different to get one that says it's for cold water specifically. Which brings us to the next step...

3. Wash in cold. We are all washing in cold right? 

4. At the dollar store you can get these mesh/net baggies for delicate clothing. I put my undergarments in them, anything light, gauzy, fluffy, lacey, easily torn, easily caught on things, something which has zippers or hardware that could snag, wool touque.  I have 2 large and 3 small. They preserve the life of your clothes. 

5. Wash everything inside out. This keeps the outside from fading as much and your clothes look new for longer. It also keeps buttons and snaps etc. away from other clothing and prevents the logos and writing on certain items from sticking to stuff. 

6. Hang to dry as much as you can. At the dollar store I got some hooks that attach over the back of a door. There are a wide variety at most dollar stores or if you're crafty you can make your own. Anything I put in a wash bag I'm probably hanging to dry. But you can hang pretty much anything. It saves on the cost of the dryer and saves wear and tear from being tumbled in the dryer. 

7. If you are going to use the dryer NEVER use high heat! It is really not necessary! Even on low heat the dryer gets SO hot! The less heat you expose your clothes to, the better. I use air dry (no heat) unless I need something dry quicker. Then I will use low heat.

8. Use dryer balls instead of dryer sheets. Dryer sheets are a waste on money and are bad for your skin and respiratory system. You can get silicone balls, about the size of a tennis ball with little nubbins all over them. They are places in the dryer with your clothes and keep them from getting stuck together and staticy. They're less than 10 bucks and last for a very long time. I've had mine 4 years so far and they look fine except a bit discolored. 

9. Really assess whether something needs to be put through the machine, before tossing it in the hamper. Can it be spot cleaned with a wet cloth? Can you hand wash it? Is it clean but just has a slight cooking odor, and you can use a fabric refreshing spray? (I make my own using essential oils as opposed to febreeze)  can you wear it to do a cleaning or yard work chore first? 

10. Liners- I have a few lovely wool sweaters and other long sleeved sweaters/shirts.
 Underneath them I always always always wear a liner t shirt. This keeps most of the body oils and sweat on the t shirt which is cheaper and smaller to wash. Same with wool socks.  Ifor I am not hiking and truly sweating into them I will wear a thin cotton liner sock and wear the thick outer wool ones again. (Wool also doesn't absorb odor as much as other fabrics but obviously if your know you have rank stank feet this isn't for you). In my bed I always use sheets as a liner - a lot of people I know seem to only use a fitted sheet over the mattress bit not a flat sheet under their blanket or a cover over their duvet. These things and thinner and take less room in the wash and less drying time. They also prevent wear on the more expensive blankets and duvets. These are just a few examples!

I'll start: 

 * I use Google Shopping to compare prices before purchasing items on Amazon. Sometimes Jet and other random websites (like eBay) sell things for much cheaper. I'll also use CamelCamelCamel to check Amazon price history and hold off buying unless if I need the item soon.

 * I check out the clearance area while shopping all year, to see if there are any things that I actually need, or presents for family members. I amass Christmas presents all year and pay about 25% of what the items usually are by buying in advance.

 * You can switch to another electricity provider without any changes to the line of your house. Takes 10 minutes to compare and make the change, and you can potentially save a lot of money over time.
 
 * I buy used books instead of new. Yes, it is more frugal to go to the library, but I just prefer to own the book and again, this thread is about not sacrificing convenience.

I CONSTANTLY see people throw out a CD as an investment tip and I tell them that you can get double the going CD rate from a high interest checking account (3%-4$).  Mine is currently 3.5% and it's completely liquid.

 Inexplicably, I keep getting one or more of these reactions : 

**1)** No you don't.  NOBODY is giving that high of an interest rate.

Uh...yes I do and yes they are.

**2)**Yeah, but you have to do all this stuff to qualify.

Stuff you do anyway?  Like get electronic deposit of a paycheck and use a debit card 10x a month? My average transactions run about 37/month.  I could have three of these accounts and still make the requirements.   Shit, that's too much work for some people?  Up to 90 extra dollars a month ain't worth it?  I find this hard to believe yet this is the most common argument I get.  If you don't make the requirements that month, you just get a lower interest rate for that month.  Big deal.

**3)**Yeah but there is a min/max that you have to put in.  

Usually they have no minimum.  The max usually caps out from 25k-35k.  Like I said, up to $90 /m usually. That sounds pretty reasonable.


**4)**LOL DEBIT CARDZ ARE DUMB IF THEY GET STOLEN YOU HAVE NO PROTECTION AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR WHOLE BALANCE.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.   From the Federal Trade Commision (.gov) : If you report an ATM or debit card missing before it's used without your permission, the EFTA says the card issuer cannot hold you responsible for any unauthorized transfers. If unauthorized use occurs before you report it, your liability under federal law depends on how quickly you report the loss.

For example, if you report the loss within two business days after you realize your card is missing, you will not be responsible for more than $50 for unauthorized use. However, if you don't report the loss within two business days after you discover the loss, you could lose up to $500 because of an unauthorized transfer. 

**TL;DR If you report it within two business days you can't be held liable for more than 50 dollars.  If you wait more than two business days to report a lost debit card, you're an idiot and deserve to lose the money anyway but then the cap is $500.**

**5)** If you're going to invest money, why not just invest it at a higher interest rate instead of letting it sit at a lower APY?

How is this even a question?  Because sometimes you need your money to be liquid!

So, tell me, what is the deal with people hating on these so much?  Explain to me what the problem is.

**General**

* *Don't Drive*. Use alternative methods of transportation whenever possible, including walking, cycling, public transportation, and carpooling.
* *Drive Less*. Avoid unnecessary trips and try to plan your route to minimize travel.
* *Buy a More Fuel-Efficient Vehicle*. If you have a beater that gets extremely poor gas mileage, consider upgrading to something more economical. 

**Driving**

* *Accelerate Slowly*. Slamming the gas pedal kills your gas mileage. A nice and slow acceleration is much better.
* *Brake Slowly*. Once your car has momentum, do your best to conserve it. As soon as you hit the brakes, you've wasted all that energy and need to build it again by accelerating.
* *Don't Speed*. On the highway, don't push the limits of your engine by driving above 70 or 80 mph. You're already in your top gear so the engine works very hard to keep up this speed.
* *Stay at a Constant Speed*.  A lot of action of the gas pedal is not good. Cruise control is your friend on the highway, but avoid using it on hilly roads.
* *Avoid idling*. With today's fuel-injected engines there is very little extra fuel cost during startup. If you're going to be stopped for more than 10 seconds, shift to neutral and turn your engine off. 

**Vehicle**

* *Keep Tires Inflated*. Keeping your tires properly inflated will require less energy to move your vehicle. You can overinflate by a few PSI, but nothing beyond that.
* *Take Out Weight*. Take everything unnecessary out of your trunk. The lighter your car is, the easier it is for the engine to move.
* *Remove Racks*. Remove roof racks or bike racks that create extra drag.
* *Clean Your Fuel System*. Use a bottle or two of fuel system cleaner. It will help your engine perform more efficiently. If your spark plugs or ignition coils are very old, consider replacing them. 
* *Change Your Oil*. Changing your oil keeps your engine lubricated and working efficiently. The manufacturer may recommend 3000 miles, but you will generally be fine for at least 5000.
* *Avoid Air Conditioning and Open Windows*. Air conditioning hurts gas mileage, but open windows also create drag. If it's not too uncomfortable, try keeping the windows up and only using the ventilator.
* *Keep Gas Cap Tight*. Make sure your turn the cap for 3 clicks to ensure it is right. This prevents gas vapors from escaping.",,False,,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,,,,self,,,Gasoline prices are surging.

We don't have a HOA (one of the reasons we bought in this area) and aren't aware that we're breaking any city codes, but this neighbor has basically gone out of her way to stir the pot and cause drama, saying she'll call the cops and get more ordinances passed, the whole nine yards. Not to mention that she's sent a few unsavory emails about people ""who were not raised here"" (we're first gen Americans) and went so far as to say (in a polite way) that people who act like us are typically called ""trailer trash"" in the south. 

While we may have one of the plainer houses on the block, that's way out of line and is really upsetting to someone who just wants to live their freaking life. 

Any ideas on how to convey to a neighbor that not everyone wants to blow $15k a year on landscaping and other meaningless beautification projects? 

Or do we say, kindly mind your own business? 

On the other hand, do you think we just need to suck it up and focus on the lawn more?

Then yesterday, I get an email. All hand creams are $5.50 PLUS they gave a ""$10 off of $30 purchase"" coupon.

I went to the store and returned my original \~$50 purchase and repurchased the same 6 items using the new deal/promotion for a total of about $23.

I think it's such a slimey thing to do to offer a ""black friday deal"" when ONLY 2 DAYS LATER you provide your customers with a hugely better deal. I feel bad for the customers that purchased on black friday and are not aware of the new promotion they send out yesterday.

&#x200B;

**Edit** \- I did not expect for this to blow up so, for everyones sake, I am just going to bullet-point what I've learned by looking through the comments. hopefully you can learn from some of these as well.

* Black Friday is not the best time to get great prices. Many retailers have amazing prices year-round. Specifically, look out for marketing (email, text, etc) for specific companies in November before Black Friday and through the end of January when companies are attempting to shed excess inventory.

We have two choices, throw a wedding with our own money and get gifts of cash and household things we are lacking, or go to the courthouse and sign a paper for much less money.

My SOs family is large, but also well-off where mine is quite the opposite so Im not sure if having a wedding would be a good ""investment"". 

I have done almost no research on the topic but I imagine our guest list would be 80-100 and if anyone has experience with costs, tips for planning an inexpensive wedding, or general input that would be great.

Unless it’s a bigger order, not that much. The kitchen is the one who puts it together usually and I know they never see those tips. 

I’ve noticed lately that anytime I order anything online or pay by card in some places, even for things like cream or acai bowls, it wants me to tip 20% and won’t leave me an option for anything else. 

For instance, we have an açaí bowl place that I will go to sometimes for my breakfast quick after I go to the gym. They pay their employees 20$ an hour for this because they were able to find employees last year. Now they are requiring 20% tip on order to basically scoop my stuff in a bowl and give it to me. I don’t understand why places can’t just up the price by a couple dollars instead. This person is already getting paid for their job and it’s not a difficult one as I have a family member who works there. 

Am I just being cheap and need to shift my thinking? Or is tipping culture in America getting out of control?

Is there a frugal way for me to clean it myself, or better to rent equipment 4x a year or so? 

We need to buy a vacuum as well, we don't own one. One do own a Bernese Mountain dog... Lots of fur!

I'd pay anywhere from $10 to $16 for 12oz of whole beans PER WEEK. If you call it $12 a week that's $48 per month or $576 per year. 

And I was pretty big into coffee shops, which is kind of a different animal but still. Probably $2.50 - $5.00 for coffee at some local places. Starbucks always seemed rather expensive to me. Dunkin too. I like Dunkin coffee better that Starbucks must be a new England thing..

But anyway, what I've realized is that Folgers and Maxwell House pre ground  coffee is cheaper per oz but more importantly I can't tell the difference between my whole bean fair trade certified organic coffee and these brands. It's saving me a decent amount of money and it lasts longer since you can buy big fuck all tubs of it. That means less trips out and less buying from coffee shops.

When I traveled to Spain I lived with a woman briefly who made coffee in a machine and left whatever didn't get drunk out overnight. Then she would reheat it and serve it the next day.

- my night stand is 2 cardboard boxes stacked on top each other (thinking of getting a cheap [ikea table](http://www.ikea.com/PIAimages/22518_PE107397_S5.JPG) to replace it)

- living room i have 1 recliner, and my computer desk and chair...though i have a nice sound setup with a 34"" ultra wide monitor, how bad would it be to put my computer chair next to the recliner and sit side by side on 2 different chairs to watch a movie?

Just wanted to share a book that was a course text for a negotiating course that I just took. 

""Getting to Yes"" by Ury and Fisher is a basic text on ethical, principled negotiation. It turns the tables on what we normally think of as negotiation. I used its principles to get $10,000 more than market value for a real estate deal, negotiate a year's worth of free cell phone service, and a lower cost on a pair of athletic shoes. All deals were made with the other side perfectly satisfied with the outcome and feeling that it was a fair trade.

Recently I returned to the dating scene and I feel like there's more pressure to spend big amounts of money on dates. When I was younger it was completely fine to go for a walk in the park or to a coffee shop. Now many girls don't want to go on free/cheap first dates.

One girl told me she's not a dog to go for a walk and she prefers dinner dates. Other girl told me that she rejects guys who invite her to a coffee shop.

Last week I had a pretty terrific situation on a date. So basically I asked a girl from tinder for a walk and she accepted it, but after half an hour she invited me to her favorite restaurant, I agreed because I thought we'll split a bill (bc she invited me). She ordered so much food and drinks, but I was ok with it. Then she wanted me to pay for everything XD I told her that I can pay my share and that's all. She barely had enough money to pay her share.

I don't know but sometimes I feel like girls just want to go to a fancy restaurant and eat food for free. And this is why they date.

Anyway, please tell me - is it possible to date as a frugal man nowadays?

With a two year contract this typically meant I could get the newest and neatest phone for some slightly less than ungodly amount of money and then get stuck paying $60 a month for the next two years lest I wish to pay a hefty fee.

Well my contract ran out, so I went and did one of the craziest things I have ever done in my life: I trusted a television advertisement. Virgin Mobile was advertising $35/mo for unlimited data with no contract and they had a pretty decent selection of phones at relatively reasonable prices, and they also don't care if you try and flash over a phone they don't approve of to their service so long as you don't call and ask them for help with it.

Long story short I paid slightly more than I would have for a comparable Verizon phone (maybe $50 more), and now I pay only $35 a month for cell phone service instead of $60, and have no obligation to do so every month. If I leave the country for a few months, I just don't pay my bill, and simply resume paying it when I get back. The data is indeed unlimited, only catch is after 3.5gb they start to limit your bandwidth. If you keep wifi on, I don't see how you can exceed that without making an active effort to do so. The most expensive plan, which included unlimited everything (minutes and data), was $55 a month.

This wasn't just true for Virgin Mobile I came to find. Many pay as you go providers offer very similar if not identical rates all with a great selection of phones. I just picked Virgin because it had the best coverage where I live compared to the others.

So it just seems to me that contracts for cell phone service are the biggest and most successful scam to ever come into existence, can anyone explain to me why anyone would possibly ever get a personal cell phone through a contract?

I’m slowly building a capsule wardrobe with items that I researched and seem to be able to stand the test of time (like my Blundstones which are all I wear for 8 months of the year). 

When I bought a car, I went with something that was used (but only a couple years old). I did have to finance it, which a handful of my friends were against because of the debt. They had purchased older cars around the same time that I did and were able to pay their cars off in cash fully. However months later, they are starting to notice problems with their vehicles. In this case, I’m glad that I spent more to have a reliable vehicle.

I make almost everything we eat from scratch using clearance and bulk ingredients, including bread, condiments, etc. We're big fans of cold cut sandwiches for lunch, and we've been buying bone-in turkey breasts, holiday hams (after the holidays) and whole roaster chickens on sale for years, freezing them until needed and prepping our own cold cuts for lunches each week. Obviously inflation has hit everyone hard, us included, but making everything from scratch has shielded us somewhat... but it's been a long, difficult week, we were out of homemade cold cuts and I decided to buy some from the deli counter at a grocery store near us last night.

I stupidly didn't check the per lb. cost, assuming it would be like, $3-4/lb like it was a few years ago– kind of expensive, but manageable. I got to the checkout and 2 lbs of normal, roast chicken deli meat from a normal grocery store cost TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It was almost $12/lb. That's like the cost of 4+ entire homemade meals for us.

Back to the old way, I guess... can't even cut a corner on something simple anymore. It's genuinely terrifying to know that buying too much DELI CHICKEN could be financially ruinous at this point. Where does it end?-

Edit: Some additional thoughts.

I am clearly not alone in this! This was just meant to be a ""vent"" post but clearly it's resonated. Thanks for all the helpful and supportive responses– I really hope that collectively, we can organize and DO something about the price gouging/""inflation"" happening at the supplier and retailer level. A start is contacting your state and local governments and mentioning your concerns with rising food costs and food scarcity– look up retailers or manufacturers headquartered in your area and mention those retailers by name when contacting elected officials. And, if price gouging continues and worsens, we need to be collectively ready to organize and protest.

This post is getting way more attention than I expected, and I'm getting some kind of awful comments/messages. I don't know how to caveat this any more than I did in my original post, but I know prices are high for a lot more than just deli meat, and I know deli meat is a convenience food (i.e., higher price point in general), which is why I don't normally buy it. That being said, I don't think it's an extravagant luxury, and no one should feel shamed for buying something that makes their lives easier on occasion– you can be frugal with your time and sanity sometimes, too. I feel extremely lucky that a) I have the time and equipment needed to cook frugally from scratch and b) I'm only cooking for my partner and I in a dual-income household. Everyone commenting ""stop buying deli meat then"" – well, that's obviously my plan, but that's not really helpful commentary, it's not just deli meat, and families who rely on convenience foods shouldn't have to starve.

Final edit: The area we're located grew QUICKLY during and post-Covid when it was named ""one of the best places to live and work remote."" Housing and food costs have risen dramatically, not to mention scarcity– my city made a number of ""largest COL increase"" lists the past couple of years (went from moderate to high, along with lots of other compounding factors) and my partner and I are indeed looking to move.

Thank you everyone who offered suggestions on the original thread. It means a lot to me. A few people asked for me to post updates.

(1) Husband has agreed to an allowance for his hobbies and personal luxuries. That amount will be direct deposited into his checking and the remainder of his paycheck will be deposited into the joint checking (he has submitted this request to HR, though it might take a paycheck or two before it actually happens. He knows that the amount he agreed to is a cut from where he has been spending. He says it's smart to make him have to learn the reasonable limit, and that his spending as a single 39-year old probably needs adjustment now that he's a married 40-year old with a spouse and new joint goals together.

(2) This year's comic book purchases aren't in the storage unit. They're in his closet here at the apartment. We're going to sort the ones that are here, and new purchases will be kept sorted moving forward (he's buying the white storage boxes today for this task). Once his house sells and we buy a new house, we'll make sure the new house has a dedicated space to comics storage and display (so we can eliminate the storage unit).\*\*

(3) We're going to read the back issues digitally for the Spider Gwen comics this month (since the first couple years of those issues are buried somewhere in the storage unit, and too difficult to access right now). Then together we're going to read the new ones as they come out -- hopefully so I'm more invested in the collection, and it gives us both motivation to keep the new incoming issues organized.

He knows it's not that it's comics that bothers me. I couldn't care less what he was into specifically. It's that he's spending a disproportionate amount of the discretionary spending on something that I don't see him enjoying, and it's preventing us from not only letting me spend an equal amount on my hobbies/pasttimes, but it's preventing us from reaching our joint goals. But, now that we've agreed to his allowance for hobby spending, it's gonna be up to him to make sure he's setting aside enough each month to pay for his comicon trips and the other bigger goals he has with his hobbies. So the specific amount spent on comics isn't really going to be an issue, hopefully, as long as he keeps his overall hobby spending to fit his allowance.

Thank you all again for the comments/insight/thoughts/encouragement/etc. It helps me to read a variety of perspectives.

\*\*This actually was an interesting conversation which I think hit home for him to hammer in that his spending on the comics was not proportional to the role it played in his life. We were sitting in the tv/AV room, and I pointed to the DVDs and such and asked how much he thinks we spend on DVDs, Netflix, etc. $200/month at most? Ok, sure. $200. We have an entire room, maybe 80-100 square feet solely devoted to the use and enjoyment of a hobby/pasttime we spend $200/month on. He spends 5x that much on comics. Do we have any space in the apartment devoted to it? If he spends, let's say, 60 hours/month watching movies and streaming shows (on which we spend $200/month or whatever), how many hours per month are we devoting to comics (on which we spend $1000/month)? 1 hour, if that? Then I pointed to the kitchen. How much per month do we spend on food and kitchen stuff? (Less than we spend on his comics.) How many square feet of the apartment is devoted to it? (It's a very small kitchen, maybe 50 square feet.) How much time per month do we spend on making food, mixing cocktails, making coffee, eating food, etc.? I mean, I know it's not a direct correlation, but this exercise seemed to at least communicate what I found frustrating about his comic collection, and it made sense to him.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,Update on husband who spends too much on hobbies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/dkjbiz/update_on_husband_who_spends_too_much_on_hobbies/,all_ads,t3_dkjbiz,1995,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1230231.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,,,1450096411.0,t2_sy0d8,0.0,{},1.0,0.0,[],0.0,1.0,,1.0,[],,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,

We buy bread flour in 50 lb bags at Costco and purchase most of the other ingredients in bulk too, so the cost of a 2 lb loaf is about 25 cents.

It's been years since I've used a bread maker. The problem always used to be what to do with the portion of a loaf that didn't get eaten right away. In the interim we got a rotary deli slicer so I adapted a solution we've used to keep frozen sandwich meats separate: cut up a sheet of baking parchment and use the pieces of paper to prevent different slices from freezing together. That trick works just as well for homemade breads!

We have an office paper cutter so I've made a stack of ""dividers"" for keeping in the kitchen, to save time when freezing individual loaves of bread machine bread.

Loving the delay start timer function. It's delightful to wake up to the aroma of fresh bread. 

Today's breakfast was coffee with two slices of fresh bread: one with jam, the other with cheese on top. It's frugal but if felt luxurious.",1.0,False,0.0,Frugal,t5_2qhbe,r/Frugal,public,,self,,,Rediscovering bread machines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/p6ycrt/rediscovering_bread_machines/,all_ads,t3_p6ycrt,20,0.7799999713897701,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,2293515.0,,,,0.0,,6.0,,,6.0,,,#dadada,451983ae-4024-11eb-ae54-0e8e3638f99d,1471648257.0,t2_10py0g,0.0,{},1.0,0.0,[],0.0,0.0,,0.0,[],,,[],0.0,1656177622.0,,,,,,,,,,,False,,

Recently we bought a new AC and heater - very expensive but we asked if they would offer a discount if we paid by cash or check (not credit card)  - got a $500 discount. (overall cost was about 7K)

Also needed masonry work on our chimney - bid was $1000, and I asked nicely if they would offer a discount if we paid in cash, and they brought the bid down to $900.

So, two simple, friendly questions equaled a savings of $600. This is of course assuming you have the option to pay by cash or check (a good case for having a emergency fund).

I'm really excited about this because I've been dreaming about owning my own car for years (went through high school and college car-less). I'm living at home now, so I can spend the money on a car without worrying about other bills. 

**Details:**

I'll be making $45k, and they're a startup so some of my expenses (food, mostly) will be paid for as 'perks' of the job.

Luckily my job is more easily accessible by public transportation than by car, but I want to start driving there eventually. I'm looking at used Mini Coopers between $15k and $22k. My mom's graduation gift to me is putting the down payment on it (around $2k), and I can probably chip in for the down payment, depending how long I work there before I buy the car. I'll get my financing through my credit union, whose rates are around 2.9% for those who qualify. My credit score is 729, which isn't bad for a 21-yo. 

Since a lot of my expenses are eliminated from living at home, I could definitely focus a lot of my paycheck on my car, insurance, maintenance, and my student loan (around $22K). 

I'm just looking for advice on how best to approach buying a car when I've never owned one myself. I've always just driven other peoples' cars so I never had the experience of going to a dealer or seller. I want the car as soon as possible, but how long is a good waiting period? Anything else I should know before I start researching into cars? Thanks!!

We also have to pay 590 for the church ceremony which we do want. No exception. We would rather just have the ceremony but my relatives want a party so we're having one. 
P.s. I'm 19, in college. My fiance has a degree and school loans, so please don't think that we are being greedy with money, we have a budget. We are getting married due to some personal/medical reasons. Thanks.

I’m horrified at how this happened. We never had such a high bill. We do leave the thermostat in 75, but we only get about $215 every month, and now I’m hearing that’s high too. I’m really sad right now because I save $150 on groceries and have to spend that much on electricity. I don’t know how it happened. I’m frustrated.

We live in Kansas. 

Update 1: I spoke to the leasing office a few hours ago. They told me that it’s common to get a very high bill. But I spoke to a friend who live in a similar floor plan as us, and their bill was $240 and they keep their home at 75 too. I feel something is wrong but I don’t know what to do.

Update 2: The maintenance guys came in to have a look and found 3 problems: our filter needed changing, a few vents were closed and a few vents were facing upwards. As a result the house was still cold. He fixed the stuff and now we wait for next months bill.
