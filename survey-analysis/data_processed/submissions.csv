1f7p0o7,GodsHumbleClown,1725330732,Composting cotton?,"I've read (and done an experiment during my undergrad) that you can compost 100% cotton fabrics, provided it's not been treated with synthetic chemicals. What does that...mean? Synthetic chemicals, does that include things like laundry soap, or are clothes sometimes treated before they get to the store? 

I always like to keep my clothes as long as possible, but it'd be nice to be able to compost them when they finally get to the point I can't wear them anymore. In particular I'm interested in using jeans as mulch, I've read about people doing that and every so often I or someone I know will have a pair of jeans that aren't really able to be repaired anymore. I don't use mulch myself (I just leave the leaves), but I've met some folks who I think might use denim ""mulch"" if I gave it to them rather than going out and BUYING mulch.  

At the moment any irreparable jeans sit in my scrap bin, but I only really use them to patch holes in other jeans, and I wind up with quite a lot of denim in my scrap bin that I'm not using for much of anything.

1eqfnqv,ka128tte,1723474042,Help me discourage mom from buying off of Temu,"My mom discovered Temu a few months ago and has been ordering some stuff from there since.  For example lately she bought cushion covers. She bought a matching set to fit with a painting I made for her birthday. She asked me if I could paint two more paintings to match with two other sets she bought. This prompted another discussion between us. I absolutely hate Temu and this thoughtless mentality around ordering there. I am a greedy little Magpie but even I know that sites like Temu are just horrible. 
My mom argues that ""everyone does it so it doesn't matter"" when I told her that it's unethical. She also believes it's an European brand because they have their headquarters in Europe. She thinks there is no difference between Temu and European or American brands that have factories in China. 

We are not poor. We are not buying necessities there. Some of the things she ordered: fake hair so hers can look fuller (she's not balding or anything), some clothing, tape, pillow covers, arm bands for watches, home decor stuff, magic cleaning sponges, ice cube making thingy. 

Honestly I don't know if I can change her mind but I wanted to at least try to get some wheels turning in her head. It frustrates me so much that someone who still has authority over me acts like an NPC. I love my mom but she disappoints me.

1flkjb4,MadmanRogers,1726860957,"Thanks to corporations becoming bigger and bigger assholes, consumerism is become less and less attractive to me. But I can't seem to fully unlearn consumerism, and thus I still always end up feeling bad. ","Been into anti consumerism and zero waste for a while now, but, always struggled with actually staying away from consumerism. But I'm getting closer and closer to my final straw. 

A lot of products are made by literal slavery, think outsourcing to 3rd world countries or prison labor. And even in ""proper"" and ""civilized"" western countries, it's mostly overworked, underpaid minimum wage workers. On top of that, I'm not far off when I say that quite literally every single brand/corporation supports war criminals, racists, or homophobes. That is if they aren't either of these things themselves, which they also almost all are. 

The fact that (almost) everything you buy or eat comes from war criminals and other human rights violators.... why should you fall into the hellhole of consumerism anymore? I get that certain things are necessary, but, other than that, why would you?

Don't get me wrong, I'm still unlearning years of this bullshit myself, but, it's starting to become more and more clear to me. Right now I'm in the phase where I just feel really bad and hollow knowing everything I buy and ever bought comes from actual human scum. Not sure I'll ever get over that feeling. Wish I could warn others about it, but either people don't want to know, don't care, or the powers that be actively suppress that kind of information from floating around. 

It just feels so bad and wrong, and yet I haven't entirely unlearned consumerism... does anyone here feel like they've accomplished that? How so? Any tips or advice? I feel like I'm stuck in the endless loop of feeling aware of consumerism, but also still stuck in consumerism itself and ending up feeling bad.

1fio34l,hlg64,1726541878,The budol phenomenon and Filipino consumption,"In the Philippines, we have a word that we use for methods that criminals use to scam you.

*budol*

It's when a con artists persuades you, almost like hypnosis, to give them your money. Only after the crimes happens do the victims realize what they had done. It's a scary scam because they put the victim in such vulnerability and leaves them very disoriented.

It has since evolved its meaning to accomodate our consumerist society. Nowadays, it's being used to describe for when you didn't want to buy a product but got convinced to do so.

Small-time sellers used this word, whether ironically or unironically, to convince customers to buy their wares. Sellers feel accomplished when they get successful and buyers feel proud to be convinced. It didn't take long before brands rode the wave of using a term for a crime method to make their marketing palatable and relatable to the hoi polloi.

Unfortunately, the Filipino masses buy into [lol] the new meaning. I was in a filipino subreddit and one person asked, ""Did you get budol-ed this 9.9 sale?"" Asian e-commerce platforms hold sales on double-digit days. I pointed out that I didn't get budol-ed because i'm not gullibe enough to be scammed and i think about a product before i buy it. For a subreddit who have a lot of people pride themselves as ""underconsumption gurlies"", it's ironic to see them get riled up at the essence of the trend they're following.

Philippines is a poor country. With the popularization of cashless transactions, Filipinos feel more ""empowered"" because they can now buy online instead of traveling to the cities to buy in malls and stores. When sale season comes, brands in e-commerce platforms coopt the ""budol"" term to whitewash it. And what's worse is consumers use it on themselves. ""Nabudol ako"" (i got scammed) is a common phrase now. It's disgusting seeing everyone normalize being scammed by brands and sellers and boast of it. They wear the ""budol"" pin so proudly.

1fck9w8,Bellybutton_fluffjar,1725869313,A rant about my guests comments on my kitchen.,"I am fortunate enough to own my house, took 20 years of saving for the deposit and I am extremely proud of it. This picture is from the advert and shows my country style kitchen.

I really like this style of kitchen. It's over 30 years old and the quality is fantastic. Real wood doors, solidly built, still in good condition. 

My gripe is that most people who come to my house says how dated it is and asks when I'm changing it. What for? Chipboard doors encased in plastic, with a Â£3000 a slab granite worktop like everyone else has? Just for it to go out of style in 3 years? The way kitchen styles come and go, this will be fashionable again soon.
